Tenuta dell Ornellaia;Ornellaia Le Volte IGT Toscana;2018;Ornellaia Le Volte IGT Toscana 2018.jpg;Wine Advocate;WA;89;Wine Advocate 89 * The Ornellaia 2018 Le Volte dell'Ornellaia is mostly Merlot, but the rest of the blend is filled out with Sangiovese and Cabernet Sauvignon. Indeed, dedicating a portion of fruit to an entry-level wine such as this (with an annual production of some 750,000 bottles) ensures lower yields and high quality for other wines in the estate portfolio. The vines are planted at 60 to 80 meters above sea level, and the soils see a mix of deep clay, red sand and rocks. Both alcoholic and malolactic fermentations occur in steel vats, and the wine is aged partly in barrique and a part cement for 10 months. This vintage is very primary and simple with bright high tones of raspberry and wild blueberry followed by some almond and toasted nut. The mouthfeel is compact and direct. Le Volte was released in March 2020.~RP

It fermented with around 20 full clusters in concrete and matured mostly in concrete with just 20 of the blend put in used oak barrels for three months. There is a component that matured in concrete egg that I was able to taste separately that seems to bring a touch of freshness to the final blend, something welcomed in a warm year like 2019, which seems like a fresher version of 2017, when the wines achieved quite good ripeness. The nose opens up nicely in the glass and is quite aromatic and floral, exuberant, with a heady touch of ripe fruit. It's young and tasty, tender and pleasant to drink, with a forward personality. A real bargain. I hope there are more wines like this in Aragon, where the wealth of Garnacha vineyards would make it possible quite easily. 150,000 bottles produced. There are two batches per year.

It fermented with indigenous yeasts and matured mostly in 5,000-liter and 10,000-liter oak vats, but 20 of the volume aged in used French barriques for 18 months.

The first thing that is going to catch your attention is the new label, which takes things from the past but put in a new, more modern style, which also reflects what the wine is like. The Via Real range (white, ros and Reserva) is gradually going to adopt this same label but with the letters in different colors. The second thing that I also loved is the Garnacha character that clearly comes through, even if it represents a small percentage in the final blend (Garnacha and Graciano like heat and do well in warmer years). The oak is nicely folded and integrated into the fruit. Very enjoyable and fresh, in line with what consumers expect but with an extra spark of red fruit that is quite remarkable for the 2017 vintage.

The Sangiovese-based 2016 Chianti Classico Gran Selezione Badia a Passignano shows some real ripeness on the close with more red and purple fruit rather than black fruit characteristics. This is a very traditional expression of the Tuscan grape and the least international of Marchesi Antinori's offerings.

They found a four-hectare plot planted 30 years ago in the zone of Mahora in Albacete where there is more influence from Jumilla/Almansa than in Cuenca where Bobal reigns. So, this 2019 is an estate wine. They fermented the full clusters with indigenous yeasts in 4,500-liter oak casks and matured the wine in a 15,000-liter oak vat for seven months. It has a different fruit profile from the majority of Bobal reds, a little less expressive and more serious. It's medium-bodied and has bright acidity and very fine tannins.

Heitz Cellar;Heitz Trailside Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon;2014;Heitz Trailside Vineyard Cabernet Sauvignon 2014.jpg;Decanter;D;97;Decanter 97 * Trailside Vineyard has been a Rutherford estate site for Heitz Cellar since 1984, and produces one of the most undersung Cabernets in the Napa Valley. Marthas Vineyard may garner more attention, but the Trailside bottling is every bit its equal in terms of complexity. Softer and more nuanced than the rustic Martha's, the nose and texture here are dictionary definitions for Rutherford: dusty, plush and long. The finish is astounding in its power and relative weightlessness. A superb wine!

Layers of red fruit laced with clove, sprigs of fresh mint and blood orange dovetail into a soy-tinged finish that you expect to fan out, though it declines; it needs maybe another 1218 months to really show what it is capable of. Magnificent. -- Neal Martin"""

There are notes of fresh fruit, rosemary and thyme, with clean aromas, open and expressive. The palate is juicy and round, and this is an entry-level red that represents the higher volume in the winery. This wine reflects the changes over the last seven or eight years: they do three tries of the harvest, and the first bunches tend to go to this wine. The well-seasoned barrels also go to this wine, and the vinification is much softer.

Palacios Bierzo Petalos 2018.jpg;Wine Advocate;WA;93+;"Wine Advocate 93+ * Their regional wine achieves unheard of levels of complexity and nuance with the 2018 Ptalos del Bierzo. It's a blend from over 90 hectares of vineyards in different part of Bierzo, 20 of the grapes from their own vineyards in Corulln, including some 4 white grapes. The rest is purchased from 180+ families with whom they have a long-term relationship. Some of these vineyards are not yet certified organic, but the objective is to achieve it in the next five years. It's mostly Menca, but there are other grapes varieties in the vineyards; they estimate about 3 of other reds, Alicante Bouschet, Gran Negro, Pan y Carne, Negreda, etc. and around 4 whites, Valenciana, Jerez and Godello, half from Corulln and the other half from other villages. The grapes were partly destemmed and fermented in open-top stainless steel and oak vats with 25 days of maceration where the wine underwent a slow three-month malolactic. It matured in barrel for 12 months. This is the wine that showcases the house style and the character of the vintage, which, in this case, is delicate and very much from the zone. There is an aromatic purity and elegance that is very captivating with a faint flinty background, the cherry essence (Mediterranean) and a touch of fern (Atlantic) plus a honeyed twist that shows up after a couple of hours in the glass. It has a silky texture, soft and caressing, with very fine tannins and the faint bitter twist in the finish. In an ideal world, this should be the first wine people drink from Bierzo, and fortunately, in many cases, it is, given the availability, even if they did a more severe selection. This is approachable now but would be better in one year, and it's going to live in bottle.~Luis Gutierrez "

The Casanova di Neri 2015 Brunello di Montalcino (this is the one with the white label) stays safely within your expectation of the vintage with its variety-driven aromas of wild berry, licorice, blue flower and balsam herb. This wine sees fruit sourced from a vineyard on the northeast side of Montalcino, with Galestro soils ranging from 330 to 480 meters above sea level. Some 95,376 bottles were made.

The wine is lithe and delicate with softly delivered tones of wild berry, rose hip, spice and campfire ash. The wine slides over the palate with a silky, mid-weight texture and calls out for an outdoor seating of warm rosemary focaccia with speck and rucola.

It's mostly Listán Negro with some 10% Castellana Negra (Tinta Cao) from a variety of vineyards ranging between 10 and 200 years of age and at altitudes ranging between 300 to 700 meters above sea level. It fermented in concrete tanks with around 10% full clusters and indigenous yeasts. Seventy percent of the volume was kept in concrete, and the remaining 30% matured in used 500-liter oak barrels for nine months. It's open and expressive, without any reduction, and it has bright red fruit, with freshness, watermelon and redcurrants. It's juicy and approachable but with complexity and freshness on the palate, harmonious and elegant and very tasty. It is an updated version of the 2016. This is a bargain.""~Luis Gutierrez"
Chateau La Pointe;Chateau la Pointe Pomerol;2015;Chateau la Pointe Pomerol 2015.jpg;James Suckling;JS;94-95;James Suckling 94-95 * This is really tannic and structured with loads of ripe tannins and fruit. Full body. Massive for this estate yet agile. Best ever. 84 merlot and 16 cabernet franc.
Chateau La Pointe;Chateau la Pointe Pomerol;2015;Chateau la Pointe Pomerol 2015.jpg;Wine Advocate;WA;91-93;Wine Advocate 91-93 * The 2015 La Pointe is a blend of 84 Merlot and 16 Cabernet Franc, picked between 27 September for the younger vines for the second wines, and 1 October for the heart of the Merlot, the Cabernet picked 8 and 12 October. Eric Monnoret told me that the 2015 was matured in 50 new oak. It has a comparatively flamboyant bouquet compared to recent vintages of La Pointe, with opulent red berry fruit, kirsch, cassis and patina of tar. The palate is medium-bodied, firm in the mouth at the moment, quite structured, the oak nicely integrated with a slightly savory finish. This is a robust La Pointe, quite spicy in the mouth with a long aftertaste. It will gain more harmony during its elevage.

Abadia Retuerta;Abadia Retuerta Seleccion Especial;2016;Abadia Retuerta Seleccion Especial 2016.jpg;Wine Advocate;WA;93;Wine Advocate 93 * Seleccin Especial is Abada Retuerta's reliable red blend produced in enough quantities to have good availability and with an approachable and easy-to-understand profile that reached great quality with the 2016 Seleccin Especial, from one of the best vintages in recent times in the region. It's 75 Tempranillo, 12 Cabernet Sauvignon, 9 Syrah, 3 Merlot and 1 Petit Verdot, a blend that can change with the conditions of the year, as it's decided by tasting the wines. If in the past this wine was quite oaky, this 2016 feels quite integrated and balanced, ripe and medium-bodied, with a soft and tender palate, round tannins and moderate influence from the levage of 13 months in French and American oak barrels. This comes from a cuve of 1,675 barrels that produced wine to fill 453,000 bottles, 22,500 magnums and 1,100 double magnums. The quality is awesome for the volume produced. It was bottled between mid-May and early July 2018.

Boysenberries, too. Full to medium body, ultra-fine tannins and lots of flavors of smoke, dried roasted chillis, black truffles, mushrooms and fruit. Bright acidity on the finish. Sexy and subtle austerity. Alluring. Very approachable now but better in 2021. "" * RP97 * The Wine Advocate 97 *  ""The 2014s, where the production of Napanook was only 2,200 cases and Dominus slightly more than the 2015 at 4,000 cases, was another early harvest, although somewhat later than 2015. The 2014 Dominus, which is 86% Cabernet Sauvignon, 7% Cabernet Franc and 7% Petit Verdot really struts its stuff. Moueix’s belief in dry farming seems to be paying off with stronger and stronger vintages, each successive year, and the 2014 is a sexy, opulent, layered, multidimensional wine with notes of red and blackcurrant, cedar wood, tobacco leaf , spice box and licorice. The color is a dense plum/ruby/purple, much like the Napanook. This is a beauty that is already drinking gorgeously – as most 2014s are – and will continue to evolve for 25 or so years. """

Bodega Garzon;Bodega Garzon Balasto;2017;Bodega Garzon Balasto 2017.jpg;Wine & Spirits;WAS;94;"Wine & Spirits 94 * Garzón’s top selection is a blend of tannat and cabernet franc, with five percent each of merlot and marselan. The vines grow on rolling hills of ancient weather granite, a soil called balasto, 11 miles from the Atlantic, where Alejandro Bulgheroni’s deep pockets financed the planting of 1,000 separate vineyard blocks. Germán Bruzzone works with consulting winemaker Alberto Antonini on the project, fermenting this wine in cement, then aging it for 20 months in large, untoasted French oak casks. The first impression the wine gives is freshness, a coastal coolness and sunny brightness pervading its berry-scented fruit. The last impression is dynamic, with energy coursing through the savory tannins that linger on the breath long after each taste. It’s silky and stylish with dark tones of oak shadowing the red cherries, blackberries and fresh plums that the flavors bring to mind. As one taster noted, “It’s like watching an Olympic gymnast; they make it look so easy.”"

It's a blend of Garnacha, Syrah, Cariena, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon from five different growers. The Garnacha and Syrah are fermented together with some 30 whole clusters and a long maceration, and the rest of the grapes fermented destemmed with a short maceration, all with indigenous yeasts and mostly in concrete vats. Sixty percent of the volume matured in barrels and foudres of sizes varying from 300 to 4,000 liters, and the rest was kept in concrete for 16 months. It seems like the combination of granite soils and the cooler year has worked wonders for this wine, which showed spectacularly. They say this is what they wanted to achieve with this wine; it is floral, expressive, clean and focused, with perfectly integrated oak, all the varieties complementing each othernot showing any varietal characterand a juicy palate with astonishing balance.

About 15 (a deliberate increase from what used to be a nominal 5) of the blend was aged in second use French oak for six months, the rest in tank. Crasto's idea with the increase in oak going forward is to change the wine's texture a bit and add a bit of gravitas. This has come together really well since last seen, fleshing out, showing a bit more power and (most importantly) vivid flavor.

The flavors have similar purity, and if these wines never have high acidity, there is great freshness, soft citrus, all very subtle and velvety. This is sooo easy to drink it could be dangerous...This is the best collection they have produced since they set foot in Bierzo in 1999. And to understand my excitement, let me just summarize it as the best vintage ever for the most coherent, reliable and serious wine project in Spain. Simply breathtaking. Bravo!!""~Luis Gutierrez"

Bodega Noemia;Bodega Noemia Malbec;2017;Bodega Noemia Malbec 2017.jpg;Wine Advocate;WA;96;Wine Advocate 96 * 2017 was a humid that had a late spring frost and a cool summer with some higher temperatures during harvest. The 2017 Noemia, produced with grapes from 1.5 -hectare plot that has been certified by Demeter for the past seven years, fermented with 15 full clusters and 20 crushed berries, and the rest fermented uncrushed in 2,500-liter open top oak fermenters with their own estate yeasts. The wine matured in first and second use oak demi-mulds for 23 months, during which time the wine was racked three times. The wine has a restrained 13 alcohol. The extended elevage made it feel extremely young and backward compared to the 2018s I tasted next to it. The oak is still noticeable, and I think it will need one or two years in bottle to integrate it completely. There is beautiful fruit, flowers, purity and elegance, with a medium- bodied  palate that reveals plenty of energy, fine tannins and long-lasting flavors, finishing with very tasty, almost salty sensations. 3,900 bottles and 150 magnums were filled in May 2019.~LG

They finally bought the vineyard in 2018, and the change in viticulture resulted in lower yields: they produced 6,000 bottles of this 2018, compared with the 10,000 bottles of the 2017. They have bought three more plots for this bottling, so volumes will grow in the future. The initial sensation fades after the wine has been in bottle for one hour, and it makes sense that it's gong to disappear with some more time in bottle.

The spicy character of the wine and the lively palate are the expression of the Graciano in their village, what they have been trying to express since 2015. It fermented in stainless steel with moderate extraction and matured in used French oak barrels of different sizes for nine months.

The wine has a full 1% more alcohol than the 2018, but there is very good acidity that keeps the wine balanced. It has dusty tannins and very ripe flavors, with a long finish—warm and Mediterranean, a little in the style of the 2011."""

The 2016 Barolo San Giuseppe is a blend of fruit from three crus. It breaks down as 35% from Le Coste, 15% from Bussia and 50% from Ravera in Monforte. There is a sultry theme here (like we saw in the Barolo Bussia) with dark fruit, pressed blackberry, black licorice and spice.

The 2016 Rosso di Montalcino is a beauty with bright and crunchy fruit that is impossible to ignore. If a Rosso can taste so good, we have great things to look forward to when the 2016 Brunellos hit the market in under two years' time. From a farming point of view, 2016 was not as easy as the no-brainer 2015 growing season. This vintage had more rain and mildew-related issues. Some vineyard spots even saw damaging hail. Pian dell'Orino made more Rosso and IGT wine in 2016 to make up for these challenges. But the UV light and the luminous quality of 2016 sparked magical results, says Pian dell'Orino proprietor Jan Hendrik Erbach. The fruit is glossy, firm and pure."""

These carry to a medium-bodied, finesse-oriented wine that has beautiful tannins, no hard edges, and outstanding length. This is a classic, traditional cuve done brilliantly.

Artuke;Artuke Pies Rotos Negros;2017;Artuke Pies Rotos Negros 2017.jpg;Wine Advocate;WA;92;Wine Advocate 92 * Produced with grapes from vineyards in the village of balos close to the Sierra Cantabria, the 2017 Pies Negros is mostly Tempranillo with some 12 Graciano. The destemmed but uncrushed grapes fermented with indigenous yeasts, and the wine matured in 500-liter oak barrels for one year, except for almost 25 of the volume, which was kept in concrete. This wine starts showing how the 2017s here transcend the year. In balos, they didn't have much frost, and the early harvest resulted in fresher wines even if the tannins are a little sharper. This wine has good ripeness and doesn't show any oak whatsoever. The wines from this year are quite pure and fresh for the conditions of the year. It's drinking very well now, but the balance and stuffing hint at a good evolution in bottle. 65,000 bottles produced. It was bottled in December 2018.

In a theoretical sensenot every yearthis is my personal favorite of Recanati's lineup, for the combination of style and quality. This seems like a pretty fine year for it. As surprisingly lush as the Marselan was this issue, this adds a layer of depth and goes one step further. The texture runs from silk to velvet and makes this very sensual at the outset. There is plenty of flavor, some raspberries supported by acidity, all finishing very dry. The fine structure supports the fruit beautifully. You can drink this right now, but give it a year or so in the cellar to pull in the wood better if you can.

It is one of the coolest climates in Montalcino, and in fact, it is one of the last vineyards to be picked. Their 2015 Brunello di Montalcino opens to fresh berry aromas with forest floor, wild cherry and cassis, with a good amount of the proverbial red fruit energy in this wine to keep it lively and vivid.

The Casanova di Neri 2015 Brunello di Montalcino Tenuta Nuova must be treated with patience, and that patience is returned with many great rewards. Blackberry, plum and summer cherry are slowly folded into lasting flavors of spice, leather and beautiful balsam or medical herb. These are always a distinctive signature of this estate. The aromas flow with seamless transitions, and that fluid and ever-changing nature of the bouquet is what helps to build intensity and staying power. Fruit is harvested from a south- and southeast-facing slope at 250 to 300 meters above sea level. The soils are mixed loosely with crushed rock, allowing access to air and moisture. Indeed, pretty mineral accents appear as the wine takes on more air in the glass. What stands out most in this Brunello is the quality of the bouquet that is rigid and firm, yet not excessively so. You feel the structural texture of the wine as it sits firmly over the palate, yet there is mobility and softness to its many moving parts. I tasted this wine at various intervals over a 24-hour period.

To make a long story short, 2018 seems to be the finest Gredos vintage in the last few years, and that's quite evident in the Bernabeleva range, especially when tasted next to the 2017s. But there is no lack of ripeness here; the grapes ripened properly, and the wine has deep aromas and flavors, fine-grained tannins and some seriousness within its approachable style. A great vintage for Camino de Navaherreros.""~Luis Gutierrez"

In this case, those mineral notes are applied with small brush strokes, as the core of the wine is occupied by wild fruit and forest berry. Medicinal herb and rosemary essence appear quietly at the back. This is a very compact and bright wine with young tannins and solid structure. It has all the attributes you look for in a candidate that can withstand long cellar aging. I'd suggest waiting five years or more before popping this cork.

Not showing any more stuffing than the Vertente, this does show more finesse. It has silky texture and impressive lift to the fruit. The structure here is better too, and that lift makes this fresh red a wine that will be a pleasure to drink. It's enlivening and almost mouthwatering. It will pair perfectly with food and age effortlessly. You can drink this young, as it is very refined, but the power does come out with air, so that would be a mistake. Giving it a few years in the cellar would be nice, for it and for you."""

The wine fermented with full clusters and matured in used 300- and 500-liter French oak barrels for seven months. It's possibly the wine that has suffered more from the bottling, and it feels a bit shy and dizzy. It's a finicky grape, delicate and ethereal, quite closed and little compressed the day I tasted it. I also wonder if the percentage of the other grapes somehow changed the wine, which feels different from the 2016. In isolation, it would be very good, but it suffers in the side-to-side comparison with the 2016. The palate is more austere, with more tannins, a little in the style of Lomba dos Ares from this year. It made me hesitate a bit, and I tasted from two bottles. 5,000 bottles were filled in June 2018.""~L.G."

I have consistently found it significantly better than when I first tasted it, so I decided to put it together with the latest releases, 2011 and 2012, to compare. The Pingus vineyards had been converted to biodynamic in the year 2000 and after the warm and dry 2009, 2010 was almost perfect. The vineyards yielded a disastrous 11 hectoliters per hectare, and the grape selection provided enough grapes for 6,000 bottles that were obtained fermenting in 2,000-liter oak vats and aging the wine for 22 months in second-fill French oak barrels. The 2010 is extremely aromatic, open and hedonistic and one extra year in bottle has only done the wine good, the oak feels much more integrated and the toasty aromas have all but disappeared. The palate is medium-bodied, with very fine tannins good acidity and freshness. This is really superb, with astonishing balance and power. With time in the glass it develops more complex aromas, with things like orange peel that really reminded me of the Riberas of yesteryear. I think I was mistaken last year, and the 2010 will ultimately surpass the 2009. A Pingus of finesse. Drink now-2025.""~Luis Gutierrez"

This is a beauty, with crème de cassis notes intermixed with spring flowers, a touch of toasty oak, blackberries, blueberries and cassis, as well as licorice, vanillin and a full-bodied mouthfeel. At this stage, it is more voluptuous and opulent than the 2010, simply because that’s the hallmark style of the 2012. No doubt this is a 30- to 50-year wine if you want to cellar it properly and nibble on it over a long period of time, but it will be much more approachable in its youth than most Hillside Selects tend to be.

The palate is medium to full-bodied with a densely packed mid-palate and oodles of freshness framed by very ripe, finely grained tannins and laced with compelling earthy accents.

Dr. Konstantin Frank;Dr. Konstantin Frank Cabernet Franc;2016;Dr. Konstantin Frank Cabernet Franc 2016.jpg;Wine Advocate;WA;89;Wine Advocate 89 * The 2016 Cabernet Franc was aged for 18 months in well-used French oak. It comes in at 13.3% alcohol. This puts it all together in most respects—concentration, structure and smooth, sensual texture. Powerfully built for such an inexpensive wine, it is also one in need of some time to develop. The one thing missing here is the expression of fruit. The olives aren't there. It doesn't have a lot of black fruits, either. Or, at least if they are, they are not rising above the wood just now (used wood—this is not drenched in vanilla). A year or two of cellaring may change that conclusion. Let's be a little conservative just now. A super value either way, this isn't going to be a simple sipper—it needs food.

The 2014 Brunello di Montalcino Vigneto del Versante sees fruit sourced from the Scopeta vineyard (planted in 2003), and this single-vineyard expression offers spicy fruit with dark berries and plum.

It's full of copious loganberry fruit, with a continuing splash of cedar and sandalwood-like oak in combination.

Despite the character of the vintage, the wine is only 12.5 alcohol, and yes, it feels a little riper when tasted next to the 2018, but it's still a medium-bodied, lightish and pale red that is characterful and easy to drink, with some cherries and wild herbs and very fine, almost unnoticeable tannins.

The 2018 is the first release and it’s a great bottle of wine that sells for a song. Coming from a mix of clones (777, 115, 2A, and Pommard) vines planted in 2014-2015, the 2018 Pinot Noir was 70% destemmed and spent a full 41 days on skins before spending a year in 15% new French oak.

Those garden-fresh aromas accompany the dark blackberry fruit that gives this wine its important center of gravity. The Merlot harvest came two weeks early in 2017, and yields were greatly reduced.

As enthusiastic as my assessment of the 2013 Brunello di Montalcino Cerretalto is, I'm stopping short of that perfect score. This vintage is something of a moving target with wines that are beautiful, without a doubt, yet the growing conditions were not even across the appellation, and achieving optimal tannic management posed a challenge to many producers. If I were to make any criticism of this wine, it would fall along those lines. That aside, this is a beautiful Brunello that boasts deep intensity and bold black fruit flavors that are plummy and rich. Spice, toasted oak and tobacco frame that primary fruit. Cerretalto ages in oak for 30 months and that strong imprint has added to the structure, depth and contemporary character of this A-list Brunello. That oak imprint is also reinforced in the wine's tannins. There's no doubt that this wine needs more cellar aging. I would absolutely not suggest drinking it within the next five years. Any awkwardness it shows now should iron itself out with more bottle time."""

As I wrote last year, the quietly confident Pierre Duroché—who once represented France in rock climbing—took over this eight-hectare Domaine in 2005. He knows what he wants to achieve and is well on the way to achieving it. Blessed with an enviable patrimony of vineyard holdings and plenty of old vines too, his hand-harvested grapes see gentle macerations and élevage with decidedly modest percentages of new wood. Stems, thoughtfully employed, are increasingly part of the equation. The ensuing wines are beautifully fragrant, with filigree tannins, vibrant fruit tones and sneaky persistence. Duroché harvested early in 2018 and has produced a lovely range of fragrant, elegant and unusually vibrant wines that I can't wait to taste again from bottle. His 2017s, which I also revisited, are showing beautifully, capturing all the inherent charm of the vintage. In short, Domaine Duroché continues its ascent, and readers who haven't yet taken notice should do so before it's too late.""~William Kelley"

The reason I placed the 2015 Barbaresco Riserva Montestefano last is because it is usually considered to be the most powerful and determined in the flight. However, when you really get down to it, this vintage is more tight, streamlined and ethereal than expected.

The wine is deceivingly streamlined in terms of mouthfeel, but that slim and buttoned-down backbone supports a broad range of flavors and sensations, from lavender essence and camphor ash to moist soil and toasted spice. All of these elements are delivered with impressive harmony and unity, and I expect that this wine will continue on a slow, steady and satisfying aging trajectory over the next 10 years or more. Fruit is sourced from across 21 hectares of vines with tufaceous limestone soils and Alberese rock, which contributes to the freshness and balanced structure of the wine.

This offers one of the most cerebral aromatics that I have encountered from this Saint Emilion estate: mineral-rich red and black fruit, quite edgy, almost flinty in style. I adore the focus of these aromas that are wired directly into the olfactory senses. The palate is very well balanced and governed by the Cabernet component. The black fruit is lifted by some lovely graphite notes that lend it a very Left Bank-like personality. It is fresh, taut and linear with a very persistent finish.

Hijos de Juan Gil;Bodegas Juan Gil Monastrell Silver Label;2018;Bodegas Juan Gil Monastrell Silver Label 2018.jpg;Wine Advocate;WA;93;Robert Parker's Wine Advocate 93 * Monastrell from their own old, non-irrigated vines fermented in stainless steel and matured in French oak barrels for around 12 months. This is the first vintage that is certified organic. There were some challenges, but they resulted in a fresh and balanced wine with integrated oak and a juicy and round palate. They have introduced optical sorting of the grapes, and perhaps that's why there is more precision and purity. They cannot do manual sorting at this price point, but optical sorting seems like a good alternative. 2018 is a more difficult vintage than the 2017, yet this wine is better, juicier and seems to absorb the oak better, with just a smoky touch that reminded me somehow of a Northern Rhne.

Although the 2008 impresses right out of the gate, it only really starts to open up with several hours of air. The 2008 Comtes represents the purest essence of the Ctes des Blancs in a great, historic vintage.

On the palate, the wine is medium to full-bodied, broad and fleshy, with a textural, voluminous profile, pinpoint bubbles and a chalky, phenolic finish. This is a ripe and powerful Dom Prignon that finds its closest stylistic analogy in the 1990 vintage, and it is considerably less evolved than the more tertiary 2000 P2 today. While the P2 is a bit drier and more precise on the finish than the original release, given the wine's slow evolution the difference between the two is less pronounced than it has been for any vintage since 1996."

The 2018 Zibibbo in Pithos is a special product with no rivals I can think of in Italy. It opens to a pale-copper golden color, with an enormously fragrant bouquet that is beaming with honeysuckle, star jasmine, acacia flower and the kind of sweet almond blossoms that color the landscape around the Temples of Agrigento in the spring. You also get a touch of ""zagara,"" which is a local word for orange blossom. All these aromas take you directly to southeast Sicily where these sun-kissed grapes are cultivated. This wine is aged for seven months on the skins in amphorae, and added dimensions and complexity are rendered by those slightly more oxidized aromas that recall caramel and dried apricot. The acidity is there, maybe the wine could use a pinch more, and you don't taste or feel much alcohol at a light 11.5, but the results are beautiful nonetheless."

Even so, in this part of much cooler Maule, the differences between vintages tend to be more subtle, and 2019 is not a warm vintage, just less cold.

It has terrific balance on the palate, with acidity that still makes you salivate and is effervescent but perhaps not as sharp as colder years.

So, the nose has an unmistakably sherry twist, with a touch of curry and esparto grass, a tendency that, in the unusual 2017, makes the wine a little riper than it was in 2016.

La Conreria D'scala Dei;Conreria dScala Dei Black Slate La Morera Blanc;2016;Conreria dScala Dei Black Slate La Morera Blanc 2016.jpg;Wine Advocate;WA;91+;Wine Advocate 91+ * There are two custom cuvées from La Conreria d'Scala Dei that were produced for American importer Eric Solomon, one white and one red. The white is the 2016 Black Slate La Morera, mostly Garnacha Blanca with a pinch of Pedro Ximénez (PX) from the village of La Morera de Montsant, where the cooler year allowed for a slower and fuller ripeness of the grapes in the higher altitude zones such as this. It is produced with grapes from two young vineyards, one on slate soils (Darrera Castells) that was planted in 2010 and another one (Perenoller) on clay-rich soils that was planted in 2011. The grapes were macerated with their skins and fermented with neutral yeasts at a low temperature and were kept with the lees in stainless steel for four months. This gave the wine some golden tints and an interesting nose, and perhaps the PX also added some nuance, even if the grape is not that aromatic. This is also quite different from the rest of the whites and has a lot less oak. It has a waxy character that reminded me of a white from the Northern Rhône (rather than a white Garnacha from the south), with some seriousness and a compact palate. It has evolved and developed more aromas and complexity. It's already there. 6,200 bottles were filled in March 2017.

Gunflint, spring honey, white flowers and salted almonds mingle over rich quince paste and warm apple fruit. The palate is equally as compelling, its powerful, rich layers of flavor packed into an ultra silky frame, offering bright pops of juiciness and a finish that goes on forever. Wow! It's stunning now but may improve with more time in bottle. Drink now-2030."""

The enticing aromas are reminiscent of ripe orange, fresh nectarine, and hazelnut, which are complemented by the palate flavors of apricot, ripe peach, and honey.

Palpable energy and tension drive a core of crushed rocks, lemon confit, mint and white flowers. Intensely saline, tense notes really bristle in this magnificent Santa Cruz Mountains Chardonnay.

There is rectitude, austerity and elegance, a subtle wine with great clout and intensity that comes through as chiseled, focused, symmetric and pure, more in the style of Roulot than Coche-Dury, with superb integration of all the elements and fine minerality. This is more about the place and vintage than the grape, which feels like a good way to transmit the chalky soils of the selected plots. Simply superb, possibly the finest vintage for this bottling so far."" *   * James Suckling 98 * ""A very subtle yet intense White Stones on the nose with stone, bone, lemon-rind and dried-apple aromas that follow through to a full body that is very tight and closed, but shows a compact fruit structure of sliced mangoes and cooked apples.

It’s silky, almost oily in texture, with ripe peach and sweet herbal tones, yet it maintains perfect balance, finishing remarkably fresh with a lasting twang of green citrus.

""My grandfather would have cried had he seen that we bottled a wine like this, without vineyard designation and not as Auslese trocken,"" says Constantin Richter. The wine is ripe, round and dense on the palate, beautifully lush and quite persistent, with a salty-crunchy grip and, again, remarkable intensity. It's still reductive, but this will be a gorgeous wine in a couple of weeks. Bottled in early March 2019 and tasted two weeks later. The wine has stimulating grip and mineral freshness, and its sweetness of ten grams is well hidden and nothing but fruit."""
