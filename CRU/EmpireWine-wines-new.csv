Argentina;Argentina;Patagonia;NQN;Bodega NQN;NQN is an absolute showcase property and the vanguard of the next generation of producers in Argentina.  The winery is a technical marvel with complete modern technology available to the winemaking team. The winery itself, is buried into the earth (ala opus one) to best maintain the humidity and the temperature necessary for making world class wines.  Owners Luis Maria Focaccia and Lucas Nemesio have rolled the dice as pioneers in the rapidly growing wine region of Patagonia.  Over Ten Million Dollars have been invested in this property, which is an unheard of sum for an Argentine winery start-up.  An empty river valley just a few short years ago, the San Patricio del Chanar Valley was identified as an ideal locale with the combination of soil, available water, which is always a challenge in this desert with almost no annual rainfall, and climate.  Several intrepid entrepreneurs began to develop this site as an eventual rival to Mendoza producing world class wines in Argentina.  The vineyards of NQN are laid out in a block system with each block varying slightly.  Different clones, rootstocks and the vine spacings allow a great deal of complexity in the final blends.  A very high percentage of the wines at NQN see time in oak.  The complexity and concentration of our wines are quite impressive.  The future shines brightly for NQN.;Chacra La Papay Malma Pinot Noir;;red;Pinot Noir;;2019;;;;Chacra La Papay Malma Pinot Noir 2019.jpg;750;10.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

Argentina;Mendoza;Mendoza;Catena Zapata;Bodegas Catena Zapata;In 1902, Nicola Catena, an Italian immigrant, planted his first vineyard in Mendoza, Argentina. The winery has remained under family control -- now in its fourth generation -- and is one of the few family-owned wine companies in Argentina that remains in Argentine hands. Owned today by Nicolás Catena and his daughter Laura, Bodega Catena Zapata is known as the pioneer of fine wine from Argentina, and Nicolás is recognized as the vintner who revolutionized wine quality in Argentina. A trained economist, Nicolás began this revolution in the early 1980s and continues to challenge himself and his team to make wines that can be counted among the best in the world. His measured approach to viticulture has taken its place in wine history as the pioneer of Malbec and high-altitude viticulture.Catena wines, first launched in 1992, set a new standard for quality in South America. The wines immediately proved the quality potential of Argentina and garnered the first outstanding reviews for Argentine wines from worldwide media. After more than 20 years, the wines of Catena continue to lead the way in Argentine viticulture and winemaking. The family and the winery's employees take great pride in carrying on the tradition that began over a century ago.;San Carlos Cab Franc;;red;;;2018;;;;Bodega Catena Zapata San Carlos Cab Franc 2018.jpg;750;20.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

Chile;Chile;Colchagua Valley;Emiliana Organic;Emiliana Organic Vineyards;Founded in 1986 by Chile's Guilisasti family, Emiliana Vineyards is a privately owned initiative dedicated to producing wines made from organic grapes and, in the case of the super-premium Emiliana Gê and Coyam, made in accordance with biodynamic principals as well. Introduction of the debut 2003 vintage Gê marked the release of South America's first ever certified biodynamic wine.The progressive conversion of Emiliana's estate vineyards began in the mid-1990s. Today, Emiliana's vineyards total 2,812 acres in the regions of Maipo, Colchagua, Casablanca, Bío-Bío, Cachapoal and Limarí. Fully 1,470 acres enjoy official organic and biodynamic certification. The remaining 1,342 acres are ISO 14.001-certified and are transitioning to full organic status at a rate of 450 acres a year. Collectively, Emiliana constitutes the single largest source of estate-grown organic wines in the world.To underscore their commitment to making world-class organic wines, the Guilisasti family recruited consulting enologist Alvaro Espinoza to oversee the project. A visionary who is regarded as one of the world's premier authorities on organic, biodynamic and eco-balanced wines, Espinoza works closely with Emiliana's resident winemaker, Noelia Orts, on Emiliana's entire range of award-winning labels. Emiliana's three winemaking facilities are located in Los Robles and Palmeras in the Colchagua and in the Maipo Valley.The Guilisastis are not newcomers to winemaking and can point to a long and proud tradition of winemaking through their involvement in the management of the world-renowned Concha y Toro label. Fittingly, the current generation has named its latest enterprise in honor of 19th-century matriarch, Doña Emiliana Subercasseaux de Concha y Toro -- wife of Concha y Toro's esteemed founder, Don Melchor. Emiliana is, however, separate and apart from Concha y Toro, with its own vineyards, wineries, winemakers and distinctive winemaking philosophy.Four distinct collections of expertly crafted wines are embraced by the Emiliana label.

It was in 1987 that our two original founders, Aurelio Montes and Douglas Murray, both highly experienced wine professionals, wanted to realize their dream of producing Chilean wines a quantum-leap higher in quality than the standards of the time. In 1988, they joined up with the other two founders, Alfredo Vidaurre and Pedro Grand, who brought their own complementary skills and expertise to the venture. And thus Montes was born, at first under the name Discover Wine. It was a dream come true for four great visionaries who succeeded in taking Montes wines from nowhere to more than 100 countries worldwide; by making 'first growth' wines respected and admired by the world's critics and trade, and by drawing attention to what Chile was capable of producing. After we created the first Montes Alpha Cabernet Sauvignon - through hard work and passion - it didn't take long to achieve recognition. It was a mould-breaking wine that immediately raised the bar for other Chilean producers.

Chile;Chile;Rapel Valley;Casillero del Diablo;Casillero del Diablo;"In the closing years of the 19th century Don Melchor de Concha y Toro discovered that his most treasured wines had been pilfered from the ""casillero"" (cellar) beneath his family home. To discourage further theft, the enterprising Don spread a rumor that his deepest, darkest cellars were haunted by the devil. Today, the original Concha y Toro family estate, complete with its Devil's Cellar, is Chile's leading tourist destination!The wines may have been stored in hell, but they are made in heaven. With its steady sunshine, cooling winds and pestilence-free vineyards, Chile is a winemaker's dream. Add to this a winemaking tradition based on French grape varieties and winemaking techniques, and you have a winning combination. High quality wines can be made inexpensively, which Concha y Toro successfully demonstrated with the release of its Casillero el Diablo wines in 1963.Making wines in volume and creating wines with personality might seem contradictory. But winemaker Marcelo Papa, who has overseen Casillero del Diablo since 1998, has managed this feat. In 2005, Marcelo Papa was named ""Winemaker of the Year"" by the Chilean Wine Guide for his ability to ""create exceptional wines that are widely available in the marketplace, yet achieve extraordinary levels of quality in spite of high production levels."" Thanks to Marcelo Papa's extraordinary winemaking talent, and the support and leadership of the Concha y Toro company, today Casillero del Diablo is a worldwide standard-bearer for premium quality Chilean wines – and the Legend of the Devil's Cellar lives on!";Cabernet Sauvignon;;red;Cabernet Sauvignon;;2019;;;;Casillero del Diablo Cabernet Sauvignon 2019.jpg;750;7.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

For thousands of years, men have found a point of equilibrium between heaven and earth. Not far away in a clearing surrounded by forest stands in silent a prehistoric megalith. The steeple of the village is on the horizon and in the middle, stands the Prieuré which is testament to the sacred spirit of this clearing in the vineyard.Built on the limestone headland which dates from the Jurassic period, the Prieuré de Cénac dominates both the valley and hills of the Cause. Here the land rises to nearly 300 metres above sea level. Although this is not high for Hervé as a winemaker from the Andes, he was immediately impressed by the quality and diversity of the soils.The calcareous base, the main characteristic of the Cause, Argentina, is covered with clay that is very rich in iron and manganese.

The Boudin family farms just over 11 hectares of vineyards in Chablis, including 5 in the premier cru Fourchaume. Run by Francis Boudin, Domaine Boudin is an outpost of artisanal, hand-crafted wine in a region that is dominated by negociants. Francis strives for purity and terroir-expressiveness by eschewing oak. Another distinguishing factor of Boudin's is the fact that all plantings have come from massal selections of their own Chablis vines rather than re-planting with Chardonnay clones from other areas of Burgundy, a more common practice in the region. Add to that the fact Domaine Boudin has an enviable array of holdings (including the rarest of rare 1er Cru L'Homme Mort, a south facing parcel within Fourchaume).;Boudin Fourchaume Chablis 1er Cru;1er Cru;white;Chardonnay;;2019;;;;Boudin Fourchaume Chablis 1er Cru 2019.jpg;750;25.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15
France;Champagne;Champagne;Gaston Chiquet;Gaston Chiquet;"Nicolas Chiquet farms 23 heactares in the Valle de la Marne in the villages of Ay, Dizy, Hautvillers and Mareuil-sur-Ay. All of the fruit (including that which is used in the non-vintage cuvee) comes from premier and grand cru grapes. Nicolas does not employ any oak aging at Gaston Chiquet; he believes that concentration, fruit maturity and malolactic fermentation impart enough body and texture to make aging in barrel unnecessary.The vineyards are planted to equal (forty percent each) parts chardonnay, pinot meunier and twenty percent are planted to pinot noir. Gaston-Chiquet also produces a vintage dated chardonnay from 5 parcels on the western side of the grand cru village of Ay. Usually recognized as a grand cru village for pinot noir, these vines of chardonnay were planted in Ay in the 1930s.""In 1919, two brothers, Fernand and Gaston Chiquet--winemakers born and bred--came together to create their house Chiquet Brothers. They were 'pioneers' in Champagne, the very first winemakers to take the initiative, bold at the time, to keep their grapes, turn them into Champagne and sell their own wine. Nicolas Chiquet planted his first vines in 1746, and since then eight generations have tilled Dizy's soil. Gaston Chiquet registered the company in 1935 and expanded the property with land in Aÿ, Cumières and Hautvillers. Gaston Chiquet is best known for making the only blanc de blancs from the Pinot village of Aÿ. Aÿ was the big name in the area long before wines became sparkling, and many were the kings and popes who counted Vin d'Aÿ as their favorite wine. The vineyards slope down steeply to the village by the Marne River, and the best locations are just over the town, sheltered from the wind and with maximum exposure to the sun.""-Richard Juhlin, 4000 Champagnes""I think if you asked me to sum up Chiquet's wines in one pithy phrase, I'd have to say either ""delicious and articulate"" or ""articulate and delicious"" depending on which you preferred. . . . I myself tend to peg Nicolas Chiquet's wines as ""innately lovable"" and so it always surprises me to rediscover just how focused and precise they are, as if the prose of E. B. White were rendered in the form of Champagne.

At that point, the House was employing around 20 people and shipping 80,000 bottles a year.Fired by a passion for champagne, a respect for traditional values and, most importantly, for people, Bernard de Nonancourt inspired Laurent-Perrier with his independent spirit and creative audacity.He established privileged working relationships with the grape growers and cleverly combined innovation and tradition. He created the signature Laurent-Perrier style of freshness, lightness and elegance and developed a unique range of champagnes which are today exported to more than 160 countries worldwide.;Brut;;sparkling;;;2008;;;;Laurent Perrier Brut 2008.jpg;750;58.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15
France;Champagne;Champagne;Taittinger;Taittinger;In 1734, Jacques Fourneaux established a wine-business in Champagne and worked closely with the Benedictine Abbeys which, at that time, owned the finest vineyards in the region. After the First World War, the wine-house was moved to a large mansion on the Rue de Tambour in which Theobald I of Navarre (1201–1253) had lived. A long-standing legend held that it was he who brought the Chardonnay grape from Cyprus on returning from a crusade in the Middle Ages. This has been disproved by genetic analysis done at the University of California at Davis.[2]The Taittingers were a family of wine merchants who, in 1870, moved to the Paris region from the Lorraine in order to retain their French citizenship after the Franco-Prussian War and the Treaty of Frankfurt (1871).In 1932, Pierre Taittinger bought the Château de la Marquetterie from the wine house of Forest-Fourneaux. It had been used as a command post during World War I and he had been laid up there after suffering a heart-attack during combat. The vineyards of the château had been planted with Chardonnay and Pinot noir since the 18th Century. This property had been developed by Brother Jean Oudart, a Benedictine monk, one of the founding fathers of champagne wine, and later it had belonged to the writer Jacques Cazotte.From 1945 to 1960 the business was run by Pierre's third son François. Under his direction, the Taittinger cellars were established in the Abbey of Saint-Nicaise, built in the thirteenth century in Gallo-Roman chalk pits dating from the fourth century. After François' death in an accident, his brother Claude took over and directed the business from 1960 to 2005. It was during this time that Taittinger became a champagne house of world renown.Champagne Taittinger was sold in July 2005 by the Taittinger family, along with its subsidiary, Société du Louvre, to the U.S. private investment firm Starwood Capital Group. Those in the profession (Champagne houses, wine-producers, cooperatives, distributors and customers) proposed that the objectives of short-term profitability, or even medium term, at any price, advocated by the then current managers of the business, were not compatible with the production of Champagne wine of quality, which takes time, trust and a large delegation of authority to the masters of the cellar. In addition, the arrival of investors completely foreign to the culture of Champagne could result in a major breakdown of the equilibrium of the industry.Finally, on 31 May 2006, the Northeast Regional Bank of the Crédit Agricole, in collaboration with Pierre-Emmanuel Taittinger, bought the business for 660 million euros. The area covers 288.84 hectares of vineyards and has 12 to 13 million bottles in stock. The Château de la Marquetterie and its cellars were part of the overall purchase. The Starwood group retained some hotels, including luxury hotels Crillon, Lutetia and Martinez, and the hotel chains Campanile and Kyriad.Claude Taittinger retired in 2006 and his nephew Pierre-Emmanuel Taittinger replaced him as head of the business.;La Francaise Brut NV;;sparkling;;;0000;;;;Taittinger La Francaise Brut NV.jpg;750;45.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

France;Burgundy;Chablis;Pinson;Domaine Pinson;"Family roots in Chablis that date back to 1640All vineyards located in the HEART of ChablisBetween Vaillons and MontmainsImpeccably ploughed Kimmeridgian soilVineyard by vineyard approach to vinification100% hand harvestedOnly indigenous yeasts usedThere are only so many certainties in life; the Earth is round, water is 2 parts hydrogen to 1 part oxygen, Joanie loves Chachi, John Lennon was a musical genius, and no Chardonnay in the world tastes like Chablis. This small hamlet, just a few hours south of Paris, relays the link between place and taste perhaps more than anywhere else in the world. The reason dates back to a unique soil formed by the recession of a prehistoric basin that once covered parts of northern France including the eastern Loire, southern Champagne, and most notably, Chablis. Known famously as Kimmeridgian marl, this limestone based soil is layered with fossils of ancient aquatic life. To say the wines from this region taste of salty seashells would seem obvious and on the nose, but it would be impossible to taste the best examples from Chablis without proclaiming that very fact. And few in this village are translating that distinct salty marine life into their wines as clearly as the Pinson family.In a region so steeped in history (and prehistory), Domaine Pinson stands out, having farmed in Chablis since 1640. Perhaps the family's most important figure, Louis Pinson, led the domaine in 1940 to become one of the first properties in Chablis to sell directly to the public, establishing them as early adopters of estate bottling. The domaine today is run by the dynamic Charlène Pinson and her father Laurent. They own 14 hectares of the crème de la crème of Chablis terroir, with prime holdings in six premier crus and the grandest cru of them all, Les Clos.It is the duty of a conscientious grower to maximize the potential of these historic parcels of land by farming in a respectful and sustainable manner. Charlène and Laurent view themselves as not only farmers, but protectors of this sacred land. They choose to not use any herbicides or pesticides in the vineyards, while also ploughing and working the soils – pushing their vines to dig deeper into the limestone bedrock that endows the wines with the unmistakable Chablisienne cut and precision.Charlène and Laurent's philosophy in the cellar is defined by an informed flexibility. They believe that every parcel requires a unique vinification. To express their terroir, some vineyards are barrel fermented, while others are fermented in tank. Aging also sees a variety of vessels, including older barrels and stainless steel –Charlène follows no dogma, only using experience to determine the best approach for each terroir. It is an intuitive process, one which results in a stunning display of intense purity across the Domaine Pinson range, seamlessly marrying the historical grandeur found in Kimmeridgian marl and the noble Chardonnay of Burgundy.";Les Clos Grand Cru Chablis;;white;Chardonnay;;2019;;;;Domaine Pinson Les Clos Grand Cru Chablis 2019.jpg;750;69.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

France;Rhône;Gigondas;Les Pallieres;Domaine Les Pallieres;Domaine Les Pallières is undeniably one of the greatest, longest-running properties of the Southern Rhône--outside the village of Gigondas, woven into the foothills of the beautiful and brooding Dentelles de Montmirail. The domaine had been a continuously running farm within the same family since the fifteenth century! Les Pallières was once a famous domaine with wines of impeccable character, yet the property had slowly fallen into disrepair. Two great frosts of the twentieth century had killed off many of the olive and fruit trees, and both the winery and the vineyards were badly in need of repairs. By 1998, the Roux brothers wanted to make a change. With no future successors to take their place, they decided to sell.The Brunier brothers, Daniel and Frédéric, of the famed Vieux Télégraphe in Châteauneuf-du-Pape, were rising stars in the Southern Rhône at the time, having distinguished themselves time and time again with world class wines. A casual discussion over lunch at Chez Panisse between Daniel and Kermit Lynch, the Brunier's longtime American importer, spontaneously turned into a game plan to revive the faded jewel--Les Pallières. Though the competition to buy the domaine was fierce with very reputable names in the mix, the Roux brothers finally decided to sell to the Bruniers and Kermit. After decades of neglect, Pallières' renaissance had begun.;Au Petit Bonheur Rose;;pink;;;2019;;;;Domaine Les Pallieres Au Petit Bonheur Rose 2019.jpg;750;24.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

France;Loire;Upper Loire;Regis Minet;Regis Minet;One could easily consider Régis Minet the Loire Valley's answer to an action hero. He may play it cool on the outside, but at closer look, one sees a man of brooding intensity on an insatiable quest for adventure. It may just be in the blood. His grandfather, Robert Minet, was an artisan tonnelier, or barrel-maker. At the beginning of the last century, Robert kept a mere three hectares of vines in the eastern Loire town of Pouilly-sur-Loire--just enough to make the family's wine. He, too, was very independent, living autonomously off his own livestock and fresh vegetables from his farm. When he passed away in 1976, Régis left his studies to continue the work of the domaine without giving it a second thought. Since then, he has made this tiny farm a full-time domaine, and has succeeded in adding an additional eight hectares of vineyards to the holdings. It is certain that his love of his native terroir translates into his wines, although one sees it in many other aspects of his character as well. Watching him fervently serve a plate of crottins de chevre to guests, seeing his latest fossilized finds after a day of diving into the bottom of the Loire River, or watching him tinker with his motorcycle after an epic ride is proof enough that Régis shares both his grandfather's rogue-ishness and love of the land.;Vieilles Vignes Pouilly Fume;;white;Sauvignon Blanc;;2018;;;;Regis Minet Vieilles Vignes Pouilly Fume 2018.jpg;750;19.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

Italy;Trentino - Alto Adige;Alto Adige Terlano;Cantina Andriano;Cantina Andriano;Cantina Andriano was founded in 1893 and was the first cooperative in Alto Adige. The vineyards are unique to the area because they are protected to the west by Mount Gantkofel which is made of dolomite rock and calcareous stone. The sedimentary rock from this peak over the years has eroded and settled forming a downward sloping hill of deposited soil at the base of this valley that expands like a fan from the mouth of the valley, over an area of 200º from south-southeast to northeast and at an altitude of 260-340 meters above sea level. This fertile calcareous clay soil is typical of the area and leaves its footprint in the wine's character. The vineyards see the sun from early morning to mid afternoon. These cooler climatic conditions with respect to other areas in Alto Adige are responsible for the crisp acidity in the wines that give them their unique complexity and freshness. The wines are elegant with good aging potential. In September 2008, Cantina Andriano was absorbed into the cooperative of Cantina Terlano, a move to unify these two cooperatives who are in the same small DOC of Terlano. The Andriano wines however are kept completely separate, as they have their distinct traits, terroir and history. The staff of Terlano manage the vineyards, vinification procedures, and the sales of Andriano wines. Andriano is adopting the same philosophy of Terlano wines: high-quality terroir wines.;Finado Pinot Bianco;;white;;;2019;;;;Cantina Andriano Finado Pinot Bianco 2019.jpg;750;15.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

Italy;Piedmont;Barolo;Mauro Molino;Mauro Molino;On a visit to Piedmont in 2004, Matteo Molino stood out amongst our group of Langaroli – and not just for his exceptional height! His wines were great and well-priced. He was quick to understand both the potential and challenges of our market. And he spoke English very well, with a great passion for Nebbiolo – not just his own. In the next decade, he and his younger sister Martina would take over the reigns at their father's estate, and guide it into the international spotlight by both making great wines and traveling to engage and charm international customers into Molino fans.Mauro Molino, Matteo and Martina's father, founded the estate. In 1973 Mauro graduated from enology school in Alba, and then followed that with five years of winemaking experience in Emilia Romagna. In 1979 after his father's passing, he returned home to the family farm in La Morra and began consulting for local wineries while building up his own estate. 1982 was the first vintage from the famed family parcel in Conca dell'Annunziata, the conch-shaped parcel pictured above, and the rest is history. In 2003 Matteo joined the company and became a familiar face to our staff, and then in 2009, Matteo's sister also joined the gang. Today they manage approximately 12 hectares of vineyards, 50% dedicated to Nebbiolo for Barolo, and the rest mostly Barbera, and Dolcetto. This estate practices sustainable viticulture.Vineyard Management: Integrated insect and disease control is followed. Control treatments are carried out only when strictly necessary (an expert consults for the estate). Sulfur- and copper-based products are mainly used. A minimum number of insect-control treatments are applied and only with low-environmental-impact products. Natural cover crops (grass cover) are left in the rows between the vines. In autumn the soil on every other row between the vines is tilled. Only organic fertilizers are used.

Italy;Piedmont;Barolo;Michele Chiarlo;Michele Chiarlo;"Michele Chiarlo WineryThe wine producing firm of Michele Chiarlo was founded in 1956 by the sole and present owners, Michele and Giuseppina Chiarlo. Son of over seven generations of esteemed wine growers, Mr. Chiarlo is today one of the most respected producers of the fine wines of Piedmont and a leading figure in its viticultural industry.At the production and vineyard level, where quality begins, Michele Chiarlo has for thirty years pursued an endless search for control over the finest vineyard sites in each of the zones from which he produces his wines. Perhaps the crown jewel among these is the vineyard of Fornace di Tassarolo in the Rovereto area of Gavi, a small parcel planted in 1910 which yields a brilliant and intense Gavi of exquisite refinement. He also has long-term agreements with the owners of two spectacular vineyards in the Castiglione Falleto and Serralunga crus of Barolo, from which he produces Barolo Riserva Rocche di Castiglione and Barolo Riserva Vigna Rionda di Serralunga. In addition to these contracts, he has also purchased the Antico Podere Averame in the Cerequio cru of Barolo, considered one of the zone's finest Nebbiolo vineyards; and an estate, also in Barolo in the cru of Cannubi, which due to its extremely sharp gradient had never been cultivated. With considerable capital investment, this vineyard has been terraced and brought into production, the first time such a project has ever been undertaken in Piedmont.In 1995, Michele Chiarlo acquired the estate of Azienda Agricola Aluffi in Castelnuovo Calcea, considered to the most beautiful and prestigious property in the heart of the classic Barbera d'Asti zone. The estate is comprised of two separate vineyard holdings, La Court and Il Castello, with a total area of 62 acres of which 50 are planted in Barbera vines, quite extensive for this area. The principally southwest and easterly-exposed slopes support superb, calcium and mineral rich soils which are of ideal composition for the production of great Barbera d'Asti.Michele Chiarlo directly manages or personally oversees every aspect in the production of his wines. Eminently qualified through the expertise acquired through his involvement with the company under his father, he also holds a degree from the prestigious School of Enology at Alba.

Trentino winemaking families are able to tap into a pool of resources and attain levels of quality that might otherwise lie beyond their reach.Strength in numbers has also enabled Cavit to develop its own showcase hospitality and research center (which works closely with Italy's most prestigious school of viticultural research at nearby San Michele all'Adige), at the beautiful Maso Torresella, a former archbishop's castle on the shores of Lake Toblino.The rewards of cooperation between Cavit's growers are apparent at every level, not least among consumers, for whom Cavit produces consistently high quality, affordably priced premium wines that have captured literally hundreds of awards and medals to date and are in demand in over 20 countries worldwide.;Cavit Zero Oak Chardonnay 187ml;;white;Chardonnay;;0000;;;;Cavit Zero Oak Chardonnay 187ml.jpg;187;1.75;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15
Italy;Tuscany;Brunello di Montalcino;Altesino;Altesino Winery;Though the worldwide reputation of Brunello has encouraged some conservatism among Montalcino estates, Altesino has always been a leader, unafraid of innovation. The estate pioneered the technique of aging its IGT wines in small French oak barrels, limiting the time spent in oak to enhance each wine's personality. The resulting wines were a groundbreaking improvement over those produced by traditional methods. No longer overwhelmed by wood, they were able to display the unique characteristics of the fruit, with softened tannins and perfect balance.Not content to rest on its laurels, Altesino became the first Montalcino estate to introduce the concept of cru wines, made with a special selection of grapes from a single vineyard. Its Montosoli Brunello, named after the prestigious vineyard, was the first of these wines and is still considered among the regions finest. Altesino also pioneered the concept of Brunello futures (wine purchased before its release) with its 1985 vintage. This commitment to innovation led to many modern wines in the estates portfolio, including Alte d'Altesi, Palazzo Altesi and Rosso di Altesino. Elegance, finesse, and a fruitier, richer style are the trademarks of Altesino's wines and have earned the estate a position among the very top producers of Brunello.

Italy;Tuscany;Toscana IGT;Donna Laura;Donna Laura;"Donna Laura red wines are produced from first-class Sangiovese grapes grown in the Castelnuovo Berardenga region of Chianti Classico. This new venture, spearheaded by owner Lia Tolaini-Banville, was initiated to fulfill a need in the American market for consistent high quality Sangiovese wines at an accessible price point that are representative of the terroir of the region. To combine the best of tradition and modern characteristics, Donna Laura wines are a blend of two Sangiovese clones, CH-20 brings structure, while F9, a more modern clone, augments the fruit intensity. A portion of the grapes come from the highly esteemed Tolaini vineyards and Lia also makes the Donna Laura wines in her father's state-of-the-art winery. As a result, the quality of care of the expert winemakers at Tolaini as well as the innovative equipment and techniques in the winery produce outstanding wine at an affordable price point.This balance of old and new character initiated in the vineyard, in cooperation with modern winemaking techniques, makes these three wines, Bramosia, Alteo and Ali, delicious to drink on their own, or equally pleasing with a variety of different foods. No wine better accompanies Italian meats, cheeses, pastas and pizzas than a Sangiovese - it's a natural pairing that is as historic as wine itself.The Story of Donna LauraWhen she was just 6 years old, Lia visited Lucca, Tuscany with her father and met her Aunt Laura for the first time. A mother to three energetic boys, Aunt Laura was instantly drawn to the gentler Lia and they quickly formed a strong bond. Then from the time she was just 11 years old, Lia spent every summer with Aunt Laura and her cousins, immersing herself in the culture of their family. This special experience became such an important part of Lia's life that after graduating from university, she returned to live in Florence to study art and spend as much time as possible with Aunt Laura and her family in nearby Lucca. Even after she married her sweetheart in Canada and returned to live there, Lia continued to visit Aunt Laura with her own children so that they would also have an opportunity to get to know this very special and incredibly wise woman who was so dear to her.Aunt Laura died suddenly of a heart attack in March of 1996. In 2004, Lia started her own label; it was natural that she would name the winery in honor of this woman who had had such an amazing influence on her life, on her love and appreciation of Italy and who Lia had, in short, become. Her appreciation of Italian culture, art and food were thanks to her aunt, Donna Laura. The label of the first wine, Bramosia Chianti Classico DOCG, was inspired by one of Laura's favorite pieces of art, a painting of Bacchus, Cupid and Venus by Dutch artist Hendrick Goltzius. Also in honor of her family, Lia named the Ali Sangiovese IGT for her daughter Alicia and the Alteo Chianti DOCG after her sons Alessandro and Matteo. Cupid on the Ali label is taken from the Bramosia painting and is a fitting image to represent Ali; in Italian ""ali"" means wings. Bacchus, the mischievous boy of mythology, is the perfect symbol for Lia's two boys.";Ali Rosato - Sangiovese;;pink;;;2020;;;;Donna Laura Ali Rosato - Sangiovese 2020.jpg;750;8.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15
Italy;Tuscany;Toscana IGT;Piazzano;Fattoria di Piazzano;"The Bettarini family have farmed Fattoria di Piazzano since its inception in 1948, when Otello Bettarini, a successful manufacturer from nearby Prato, fell in love with the area's rolling landscape and bucolic charm.  But winemaking in these tufted hills south of Empoli goes back considerably farther than that; archeological excavations on the property have unearthed wine amphorae dating from the 4th century CE!  In fact, the very name Piazzano is derived from the Latin ""Fundus Plautianus,"" or ""Plautus' Farm,"" a proud acknowledgement of the land's heritage and historical esteem.  And a closer look at the estate's unique placement may reveal why: the property runs across a geological fault line, the resulting tectonic mashup of which exhumed an astonishing array of distinct soil types throughout the vineyards.  Today, brother and sister Rolando and Ilaria Bettarini take shrewd advantage of this diversity in terroir, vinifiying each plot separately, blending only the best expressions and selling off the remainder.  For decades this passionate, family-run operation has produced quality wines of typicity at a fraction of the price of its better-known neighbors within the bounds of Chianti Classico a few miles to the east.Farming Practice:Practicing Organic";Ventoso IGT Tuscan Red;;red;;;2019;;;;Fattoria Piazzano Ventoso IGT Tuscan Red  2019.jpg;750;9.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15
Italy;Tuscany;Tuscany;La Spinetta;La Spinetta;"""One of Italy's most fashionable winemakers/proprietors, Giorgio Rivetti displays a masterful touch whether he is making Barbera, Moscato d'Asti, or his proprietary red wine Pin."" – Robert Parker, Jr.""Giorgio Rivetti, owner and winemaker of La Spinetta in Barbaresco, has become one of the leading forces in Piedmont. He's making exciting ripe, fruit-forward Nebbiolos that would give many highly rated New World wines a run for their money. Now he's making waves in Barolo....Rivetti is first and foremost a winemaker--one of the best and most innovative winemakers in Piedmont today. But he is also in tune with today's consumer, whom he believes shares his preference for wines that are more approachable on release."" -- The Wine SpectatorGiorgio Rivetti's magic touch with Moscato, Barbera, Nebbiolo and, more recently, Sangiovese, Colorino, Vermentino and Sangiovese Rosé has taken the wine world by storm. He produces approachable yet age-worthy wines that command the attention of wine critics and consumers alike, year-in and year-out; their lushness, concentration, aromatics and length are unrivaled. Giorgio's speedy ascent from Moscato producer in the 1970's to venerated Barbaresco and Barolo vigneron today is studded with success.The genius of La Spinetta encompasses a vast array of great wines, all boasting an inimitably approachable and voluptuous style. From Moscato to Nebbiolo to Sangiovese, whatever Giorgio touches turns to gold. His pioneering single-vineyard Barberas and Barbera/Nebbiolo blend ""Pin"" are considered to be the best of the Langhe. His Barbareschi and Baroli are at the very top of their category. In fact La Spinetta's wines are among Italy's most celebrated, as the winery has attained the coveted Tre Bicchieri award for more than 30 of their wines throughout their relatively short career. Let it never be said, however, that the greatness of La Spinetta is inaccessible to the average consumer; from the longtime favorite Barbera d'Asti ""Ca' di Pian,"" featured in numerous magazines as a Best Value, to the Langhe Nebbiolo, a bottling of young vine fruit from the famed Starderi vineyard in Barbaresco, the winery offers incredible opportunities to experience the beauty of their best crus at a fraction of the cost.In addition to the wines of La Spinetta, Giorgio Rivetti and his son Andrea have recently taken ownership of the beautiful and historic Contratto estate, where they produce both sparkling wines and a line of spirits. Giuseppe Contratto founded Contratto in 1867, and the estate remained in the family's hands for 126 years. In 1993, Carlo Bocchino purchased the property, and the historical cellars underwent substantial renovations. In 2011, Giorgio Rivetti and the La Spinetta took ownership of this understated jewel with the goal of reviving Contratto to its former glory. Today, a UNESCO World Heritage site, Contratto produces traditional method sparkling wine and selected spirits that we are proud to represent.";Casanova della Spinetta Il Rose di Casanova;;pink;;;2020;;;;Casanova della Spinetta Il Rose di Casanova 2020.jpg;750;12.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15
Italy;Tuscany;Tuscany;Poggio Scalette;Poggio Scalette;Poggio Scalette takes its name from the landscape, which is characterized by dry, stone walls supporting terraces on which the vineyards and olive groves are planted. From a distance the impression is of a series of stairs climbing the slopes of Greve. After the death of its previous owner, Poggio Scalette remained abandoned for years until Vittorio Fiore, one of Italy's most famed winemakers, discovered the property in 1991 with his wife, Adriana. In 1996, 42 additional acres of land became available, enabling them to expand. It was discovered that the plot of land known as Il Carbonaione was the first area to be replanted after World War I (1914-1918), which means these vines, more than 90 years old, are a rare example of the original clone of the famous Sangiovese di Lamole variety in the Chianti Classico area.;Il Carbonaione;;red;;;2017;;;;Poggio Scalette Il Carbonaione 2017.jpg;750;56.99;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15
Italy;Tuscany;Maremma;Prelius;Prelius Vineyards;"In the hilly amphitheater of Tuscany's Maremma region, above an ancient coastal lake called Prelius, a vineyard organically farmed by the Stianti Mascheroni family flourishes. This vineyard, also called Prelius, is the first venture outside of Chianti Classico for the Stianti Mascheroni family, leaders in Tuscany's organic viticultural movement.MaremmaThe 21-hectare (52-acre) estate, purchased in 2007, is located in the municipality of Castiglione della Pescaia in the Grosseto region and is neighbored by the vineyards of Antinori and Bellavista.Grosseto lies in the central part of the Maremma region, south of Bolgheri and north of Lazio, in the westernmost part of Tuscany. A plain carved by centuries of rivers and floods, Maremma is bordered by the coastline of the Tyrrhenian Sea, which is part of the Mediterranean Sea. To the east is a low range of maritime hills covered with Mediterranean ""macchia,"" a mix of plants and trees that is often credited for lending wines of the area a distinctive flavor.Benefiting from the proximity to the sea, the Maremma has mild winters that rarely experience temperatures below freezing. Summer temperatures are relatively high during the day, but cool off in the evening due to breezes that flow from the sea to the hills. These breezes also help to keep humidity at bay. Rainfall primarily occurs in late autumn, winter and early spring.OrganicThe Stianti Mascheroni family is committed to organic farming at the Prelius estate. These efforts are aided by both nature and man. Mother Nature does her part by providing continual breezes throughout the day and night, which keep humidity at bay, preventing fungus and mold. Insect pests are controlled by an innovative natural technique referred to as sexual confusion, which is accomplished by releasing pheromones to confuse the males, who then cannot locate females and reproduce. And, all fertilization is achieved with organic manure.SiteA mere five kilometers (just over three miles) from the Tyrrhenian Sea, the Prelius vineyard sits on a cornice under the historic Castellaccio di Prile, one of the region's early protective fortresses. The vineyard elevation ranges from 37 to 52 meters (120 to 170 feet) with a slope just shy of 5 percent.The 12 hectares (29.7 acres) of vines on the estate were planted between 2001 and 2005 to Cabernet Sauvignon (6.35 hectares or 15.7 acres), Sangiovese (2 hectares or 5 acres), Vermentino (2.1 hectares or 5.1 acres), Merlot (1.05 hectares or 2.6 acres) and Cabernet Franc (0.5 hectare or 1.3 acres). The tightly spaced rows are approximately 4 feet apart with 3 feet between vines, resulting in 8,649 to 9,884 vines per hectare (3,500 to 4,000 vines per acre). Row orientation is northwest to southeast. The vines are trained using a modified Guyot system. A drip system provides irrigation from a reservoir on the estate.SoilThe reddish-orange alluvial soil on the Prelius estate, rich in sand and gravel, is the result of centuries of glacial melting, changing river directions, floods and high winds. These natural acts have delivered sandstone from the nearby maritime hills, which has mixed with the deep, loose sand of the coastline to create well-draining soil.PracticesDue to the tight spacing of the rows, all pruning is completed by hand. While pruning, the vineyard staff walks the vineyards pushing a steel lorry in which they burn clippings. Once burned, the ash is returned to the ground through small holes in the lorry, providing nutrients to the soil.Vermentino grapes and a small portion of red grapes, which will be used for the estate's signature blend, CastelPrile, are harvested by hand. The remaining red grapes are harvested using a Bobard tractor, which allows the grapes to be harvested quickly -- the heat of the Maremma can push a grape at its peak ripeness to overripe in a single day.CertificationPrelius practices organic farming certified by the EU.Zero ImpactTo offset CO2 emissions at the winery, Prelius works with LifeGate, a global organization which equalizes the CO2 emissions by replanting forests in Madagascar. Prelius received from LifeGate the ""Impatto Zero,"" or ""Zero Impact,"" certification which is recognized by the EU.FamilyPeople are always the foundation for any success story. So it's no surprise that what lends Prelius its strength is the Stianti Mascheroni family. Leaders in Tuscany's organic viticultural movement, the family revitalized the village of Volpaia in the heart of Chianti Classico near Radda in Chianti.An avid sailor, Carlo had long spent time on the coast of the Maremma and more recently began to search for a retirement home on its idyllic seashore. Instead, an offer to look at a property with a vineyard was proposed. The family arrived on a clear, sunny September day in 2005 and its fate was sealed. Two years later, Prelius was established.Three decades earlier, Giovannella and Carlo received Volpaia as a wedding gift from the bride's father. History repeated itself when Carlo and Giovannella Stianti Mascheroni presented Prelius to their daughter, Federica Mascheroni Stianti.With an arts education, Federica had pursued a career in a contemporary art gallery as a painting restorer (she has recently completed the restoration of the important Temper on panel at the Basilica di San Leonardo in Florence), but always remained close to the family's activities at Volpaia. In more recent years, she had begun to cultivate an interest in agricultural pursuits.Federica will manage the Prelius estate with the assistance of Lorenzo Regoli, vineyard manager and first resident winemaker at Castello di Volpaia since 2000. Consulting winemaker Riccardo Cotarella will bring technical innovation, new ideas, and suggestions during the final blending process to Prelius, as he has to Volpaia since 2001.WineThe Prelius estate makes three wines: Vermentino, Cabernet Sauvignon and CastelPrile.The Vermentino offers fresh pineapple and apple flavors with floral aromas. A late-ripening, aromatic white grape variety, Vermentino originated in Spain and flourishes in seaside conditions where a mix of sunshine and breezes result in balanced acidity with tropical fruit aromas and flavors.The Cabernet Sauvignon is a rich, yet elegant wine with beautiful tannins and a long, seamless finish. Intended for drinking young, it is aged for nine to 10 months in large French oak casks and then in the bottle for approximately three months.In 2010, Prelius will release its flagship wine, CastelPrile, a blend of Cabernet Franc and Cabernet Sauvignon.The LabelThe Prelius label reflects the fluid nature of a coastal lake which was once where the vineyards of the Maremma region in Tuscany are today. As the area has evolved, it has established itself as an excellent location for viticulture and winemaking. The Prelius vineyards are located on a hilltop along what was once the shore of the ancient lake, three kilometers (nearly two miles) from the Tyrrhenian Sea.The winery has received high-profile recognition for its contemporary label design, including a ""Gold Label"" award from Vinitaly's International Packaging Competition and a ""Red Dot"" award by the Design Zentrum Nordrhein Westfalen in Essen, Germany.";Cabernet Sauvignon;;red;;;2019;;;;Prelius Cabernet Sauvignon 2019.jpg;750;16.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15
Italy;Tuscany;Tuscany;Fanti;Tenuta Fanti;The Fanti Family has been producing wine and-extra virgin olive oil in Tuscany for nearly 200 years. In the 1970s, current owner Filippo first took over the Estate, marking a major turning point in its history. After redesigning and replanting across its 300 hectare property, an innovation-meets-tradition winemaking technique has resulted in extremely high-quality grape growing, all while avoiding any non-organic fertilizers. Eighty percent of the plantings in the vineyards are Sangiovese or Sangiovese Grosso, a focus that reinforces the family's commitment to the quality wine of the region and which is reflected in Fanti's highly rated Brunelli. Filippo's daughter Elisa joined the team in 2007 and has since been instrumental in reinforcing their position in the international market.When Filippo decided to reconfigure their 300 hectare property, he allocated 50 hectares to be grape vines, just half that of the olive grove. He apportioned other plots of the property to crops and woodlands in a layout that was designed to nurture the vineyards. With soil that is laden with limestone and clay, optimal daytime sun exposure and a nighttime thermal drop, the viniculture is carefully orchestrated to mirror the flavors and aromas of both the grape and the territory. The winery itself is partially built into a hill to reduce visual impact and protect the scenery.Inside the winery, Filippo himself has carefully selected everything, from the sorting table, stainless steel vats and pumpover system to a very high standard of barrel selection. As a result, Fanti continues to produce hallmark Southern Montalcino wines with the help of their surrounding terroir and passion for making approachable wines for new wine makers and seasoned pros alike.;Rosso Poggio Torto;;red;;;2018;;;;Fanti Rosso Poggio Torto 2018.jpg;750;13.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

New Zealand;New Zealand;Marlborough;Huia;Huia Wines;Hollywood actor, Cameron Diaz, recently dipped her toe in the wine industry by launching a wine label that differentiates itself through the concept of being 'clean'. What that means is, the wine is void of any synthetic chemicals like pesticides and herbicides and any additives that would usually be introduced during the winemaking process.You know what? We're behind her 100%!Although we can see the appeal, we don't use the term 'clean' for wines that are made naturally and that don't use any chemicals. We prefer 'certified organic'. It shows we've had an independent body identify that we do what we say we do. At its heart, organic winemaking is about being able to work a farm without relying on chemical intervention. All our wines are also vegan suitable. We prefer to let time and gravity 'fine' our wines to provide clarity and ensure they arrive with you tasting the best.To be honest, making organic wine is a bloody dirty business! It requires a breath of knowledge and constant learning about how the land responds to changing seasons, drought or floods, frosts or bugs. It's labour intensive and hands-on and that's not just at harvest time. Anyone who has pruned a vine in the middle of Winter in close to zero temperatures can attest to that!We call this piece of land we live and work on ours, but we really know it won't be ours for long in the grand scheme of things. Even now we share it with a lot of other living things that deserve a harmonious existence. There is no place for chemicals at Huia and no place for animal by-products in our wine.So we just wanted to say, cheers to Cameron for using her profile to shine a light on the other side of winemaking. We're chiming in to say: we grow our grapes and make our wines and we do it organically, without using any chemicals. We get our hands very dirty!Huia wines are certified organic, suitable for vegans and made using minimal sulphur additions. That all sounds serious and truthfully, we are serious about that side of the biz. However, when it comes to drinking the stuff, we're not so serious at all and as long as there's a platter of good nosh on the table and good mates around it, then we're sitting in our happy place.To support more organic farmers learn about our fellow members of MANA Winegrowers and why not try a bottle?

New Zealand;New Zealand;Marlborough;Marisco;Marisco Vineyards;Marisco was selected as the New Zealand winery of the year in 2011 by the IWSC in London. The Marris family are descendants of William de Marisco (approximately 1100 AD), who was said to be one of the 35 illegitimate children of King Henry the First. They are pioneers in the wine industry of the Marlborough wine region.Their vineyard is located on the banks of the Waihopai River and on the Southern side of the Wairau Valley. The Waihopai River runs the length of their 268 ha vineyard and not only provides a picturesque boundary but its ancient river shingles are an essential part of the vineyard's terroir. This location consistently enjoys warmer daytime temperatures and lower rainfall than areas to the North. These daytime temperatures, followed by cool nights, encourage intense flavor development which is the hallmark of Marlborough wine. In February 2009 they broke ground on a new 6,000 ton state of the art winery, and the 2010 vintage was the first crush in the new facility.Marisco produces three brands, Fernlands, The Ned and The Kings Series. Fernlands is the newest of the wines produced by Marisco. The fruit is all estate grown. The Ned was launched in 2006 and is named after one of the tallest, most rugged peaks to the southeast of their vineyard. In October 2009 they launched The Kings Series range, a celebration of their family heritage dating back to the 12th Century.  Each wine in the range tells a story about their ancestors, the de Mariscos, and their tempestuous relationship with the English monarchy.;Vineyards Fernlands Sauvignon Blanc;;white;Sauvignon Blanc;;2020;;;;Marisco Vineyards Fernlands Sauvignon Blanc 2020.jpg;750;9.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

New Zealand;New Zealand;Marlborough;Zephyr;Zephyr Wines;The Glover family were one of the first to plant grapes on their farm in Marlborough's Dillon's Point sub-region in 1988. Nineteen years later, led by eldest son Ben, the family launched Zephyr, a range of single vineyard wines from the farm. The name Zephyr means 'a gentle breeze'. Inspired by the prevailing wind that moderates their vineyards, it is the perfect fit for the Glover family. Never still, always on the go, always innovating and planning their next move on the farm, in the wines and with the family.The family farm runs alongside Marlborough's Opawa River and over four generations was home to a successful dairy operation. Owen Glover dedicated much of his life to developing a revered pedigree Friesian herd. But after realising his four children had no interest in getting up at 5:00am to milk cows, Owen and Wendy looked over the fence. Inspired by the pioneering efforts of some other Marlborough mavericks, they opted to swap out milk for wine, selling the herd and converting the paddocks to vineyard. They had a feeling their Dillon's Point land had the potential to produce world class wine, and this new venture might mean an end to early mornings.Today, rows of Chardonnay, Gewurztraminer, Riesling, Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir and Sauvignon Blanc have thrived in the fertile loam soils that provide Zephyr wines with lively aromatics, great depth of flavour and excellent structural longevity.Zephyr wines are made in Ben's trademark expressive style, elegant with personality. Ben has spent more than two decades making wine for some of New Zealand's top brands, earning a reputation as one of the most talented and respected winemakers in the business.;Wines Agent Orange Wine;;white;;;2020;;;;Zephyr Wines Agent Orange Wine 2020.jpg;750;19.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

Portugal;Portugal;Vinho Verde;Anselmo Mendes;Anselmo Mendes;"Anselmo Mendes is, simply put, one of Portugal's most revered winemakers. A native son of Monção (which, along with neighboring Melgaço, where his cellar is located, is one of the top Alvarinho crus in the country), he hails from an agricultural family that, like most in the area, dabbled in wine for household production. It wasn't until after university studies in agronomy that he began to specialize in wine, studying in both Portugal and France and enjoying a rapidly rising star as one of the most sought-after consulting winemakers in Portugal.In 1998, he finally struck out on his own, producing his first own-label wines from rented grapes in the Monção e Melgaço zone, and his (at that time highly unusual) focus on a bone-dry, mineral, serious, no-fizz style rocketed him to the top of the list as Winemaker of the Year in the Revista de Vinhos, Portugal's chief domestic wine publication. (He has since repeated that accolade.) It was then that he also garnered the charming nickname with which he is still associated today -- ""Mr. Alvarinho"". And indeed, his skill with this grape puts him into any conversation about the best producers in the Vinho Verde demarcated zone, though that skill is supplied no longer by rented vines but one of the most significant estate holdings of Alvarinho in the area.But Mr. Alvarinho is dedicated to exploring multiple facets of this very far-from-monolithic appellation, and over the last couple decades has extended his masterful touch to encompass both Loureiro from the Lima Valley (just south of Monção and Melgaço) and Avesso from Baião (even farther south, in the lower Douro valley but still in the Vinho Verde zone). His Muros Antigos (""ancient walls"") line is a fascinating parallel exploration of all these terroirs and varieties from a relatively neutral and hands-off winemaking perspective. If Alvarinho is the most citric and bracing (as well as the most famous), Loureiro is slightly broader, more textural, and headily aromatic. Avesso, meanwhile, the least well-known (but best-regarded locally after the other two varieties) produces wines with the most heft and structure, which makes it a compelling blending partner in the Escolha bottling.The Muros Antigos wines are all unoaked and see long, slow fermentations at low temperature with indigenous yeasts. The lees contact is relatively short– around four months– making for crisp, lively wines that, while demonstrating some of the best quality/price rapport in the region, nonetheless bring a serious amount of concentration and varietal character to the the table, all in the fizz-free, bone-dry idiom Anselmo helped pioneer. (And the Alvarinho in particular will age, too– a recently-tasted 2012 was showing beautifully complex– Chablisian, even– evolution while staying fresh as a daisy.)";Muros Antigos Albarinho;;white;;;2020;;;;Anselmo Mendes Muros Antigos Albarinho 2020.jpg;750;14.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

He establishes an office in New Jersey but, on returning to Spain, he loses his life in the Spanish Civil War, leaving his wife and children to run the winery.1940s – Dolores continues to build the business in the tough post-war era, launching Carta Nevada in 1941. The unique frosted golden bottle goes on to become one of Freixenet's most popular cavas.1950s – Dolores' youngest son, José Ferrer, takes the reins of the family business with the goal of realizing his parents' dreams of introducing Freixenet to the world.1970s – Following the Casa Sala tradition, the family ships the first bottles of Freixenet to the United States. José Ferrer, with a keen intuition, introduces Freixenet Cordon Negro in 1974, a new cava bottled in a radically distinctive dark frosted bottle, which would become known as the ""Black Bottle Bubbly"".1980s – Through the constant efforts of José Ferrer and his sons and nephews, Freixenet becomes the world leader in sparkling wine produced in the traditional method.Today – A century since Freixenet released its first cava in 1914 the company remains 100% family owned, with the fourth generation now entering the business, ready to celebrate 100 years and many more to come.";Alcohol Free Sparking White;;sparkling;;;0000;;;;Freixenet Alcohol Free Sparking White.jpg;750;8.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

Spain;Castilla y Leon;Rioja;La Rioja Alta;La Rioja Alta;Few dispute that La Rioja Alta S.A. is the leading quality orientated producer in the Rioja. With more than 50,000 casks and 6.4 million bottles stored at any one time, the equivalent of about 8 years sales, La Rioja Alta S.A. is unique in its ability to supply large quantities of fully mature wines of world class quality.The company owns 300 hectares of vineyards in different parts of the best zones of the Rioja Alta region. La Rioja Alta S.A. is specialized in red wines. The leading grape variety is the Tempranillo with small doses of Mazuelo and Graciano. The Vina Ardanza differs from the other wines with some 25% Garnacha in the blend. After vinification in the new ultra modern vinification plant near Haro, aging is in traditional Bordeaux casks, all made from American oak. Racking is by hand every 6 months with 8 teams working full time racking the 51,000 casks. There is no filtration prior to bottling and further long aging in bottle before release.In short the wines are made in the traditional Rioja manner. The company is adamant about not using French oak, keeping the unique Rioja style which has been developed since the end of the 19th century. In spite of the varying amount of time in cask and bottle the wines all display a wonderful rich ruby colour, gorgeous aromas of oak, spices and fruit followed by a sensational feel on the palate, with a wonderful smooth texture, clean rich oaky/fruity flavours and a long lingering finish. All the wines are ready for consumption on release but will keep for many more years in bottle. This situation is almost unique in the world of wine and is the reason why so many restaurants list La Rioja Alta's outstanding range of truly classic Rioja wines.HISTORYThe Bodega was formed in 1890 as a partnership of 5 quality-conscious growers keen to exploit the export potential for well-made, 'modern' Rioja. At this time, French vineyards were ravaged by phylloxera, and connoisseurs were having to look elsewhere for supplies of fine wine. Rioja, with its excellent climate and soils, had already attracted attention, and experiments with Bordeaux-style vinification and barrique-aging were proving very successful. The region's only real disadvantage was its remoteness, cut off from the lucrative markets to the north by the same mountains that ensured its favorable climate. This problem was solved by construction of the rail link to Bilbao, and it is no coincidence that Bodegas La Rioja Alta was established next to the Haro railway station in the same year it opened.In 1904, La Rioja Alta absorbed Bodegas Ardanza, and gained access to some of the finest vineyards in the Rioja Alta district. The luxury 904 bottling commemorates this important milestone in the company's development. Since then Rioja has seen more bad times than good, and many producers have harmed the reputation of the region and its production methods, releasing sloppily-aged wines which were never good enough to support a long time in cask. But La Rioja Alta has never let standards slip, and continues to this day the tradition of careful long-aging that gives Rioja its unique character. These wines offer a wonderfully complex bouquet, rich flavours, a seductively smooth texture, and are all ready to drink on release.Farming Practice:Practicing Organic;Vina Alberdi Rioja Reserva;;red;;;2016;;;;La Rioja Alta Vina Alberdi Rioja Reserva 2016.jpg;750;17.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15
Spain;Castilla y Leon;Rioja;Lopez De Heredia;Lopez De Heredia;"Lopez de Heredia - one of the most venerable producers in Spain– produces traditional, age-worthy Rioja. Their wines are legendary and still made the way they were when the winery was founded over 130 years ago. Following a tradition that has been passed down through generations, their wines are released at least 5-10 years after harvest, which provides added complexity and elegance to their Crianzas and Gran Reservas.A rarity in Rioja, Lopez de Heredia uses only estate bottled fruit from their prized vineyards- Tondonia, Cubillo, Bosconia, and Zaconia- with the idea that the only way to get the best fruit is to care for the vines themselves. The Tondonia vineyard is their most famous; over 100 hectares, it is situated in a shell-shaped depression on the right bank of the river Ebro, where the most typical Rioja wines are grown. The soil is alluvial clay with a high proportion of limestone. Average vine age is 45 years old and organic farming and natural fermentations are implemented, creating wines that exhibit great terroir. Grapes from Viña Tondonia are always used in making their highest quality wines, with truly exceptional vintages becoming Gran Reservas. The first Reserva was bottled by the founder in 1890; a few bottles of this are still kept in the family wine museum.The winery itself is a remarkable structure. When D. Rafael López de Heredia y Landeta began building the bodega in the late 1800's, little did he realise that his masterpiece would one day be acknowledged as an example to the rest of the industry of the most perfect combination of buildings and vineyards. Like many medieval masterpieces it is still incomplete. The buildings stand below and above ground, and are a veritable ""cathedral to wine"".  Moving through the vaulted underground corridors and staircases, you find yourself travelling back in time, and the founder's touch can still be sensed in the very stones and fabric of the building.";Cubillo Crianza;;red;;;2012;;;;Lopez de Heredia Cubillo Crianza 2012.jpg;750;24.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

Spain;Catalonia;Catalonia;Castillo Perelada;Castillo Perelada;"Wine has been made at the Castillo Perelada since the Middle Ages, as shown in several documents and parchments from the period to be found in the library. When Miguel Mateu bought this ensemble of monuments in 1923, one of his primary objectives was to revitalize the wine producing tradition, a tradition that is more alive than ever these days and which has incorporated the most modern technology to create wines that make full use of the nuances of the soils and vines of the Empordà.Since its foundation, Perelada has been recognised for its commitment to quality through the great international popularity of its wines. In the 1960s, the success in the United Kingdom of what at the time was called ""Champagne Rosado de Castillo Perelada"" made the sparkling wine producers of the Champagne region in France appeal to the courts to obtain exclusive rights over the use of the name. They won, so the other regions had to look for alternative denominations. In the case of Spain, this gave rise to the Cava D.O. In any event, far from harming Castillo Perelada, the dispute benefited the bodega as free publicity.Over the decades the wines of Perelada have had the honour of being chosen for official banquets of unquestionable historical significance, such as the coronation of King Juan Carlos I, the wedding of the Prince and Princess of Asturias or for visits from United States presidents Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford.Naturally, Perelada's interests centered since the early years on the Empordà D.O. It is within this wine-growing region that the bodega has been regularly acquiring new vineyards and selectively planting different grape varieties, always on the basis of research carried out by an expert team of oenologists.Over the years, Perelada wines have been the deserving winners of many awards in national and international contests. The three gold and two bronze medals achieved in the 5th Sélection Mondiale des Vins, Alcool et Liqueurs of Paris in 1967 marked one of the key moments in the bodega's history. Yet it has been in recent years that the Castillo Perelada wines have positioned themselves among the most highly commended in Spain thanks to the medals won in contests such as the Concurso Internacional de Vinos Bacchus, La Nariz de Oro, Vinalies Internationales, Challenge International du Vin, Concours Mondial de Bruxelles, International Wine & Spirit Competition, Decanter World Wine Awards and Mundus Vini.";Rose Pescador NV;;pink;;;0000;;;;Castillo Perelada Rose Pescador NV.jpg;750;8.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

USA;California;Napa Valley;Far Niente;Far Niente;"Far Niente was founded in 1885 by John Benson, a forty-niner of the California gold rush and uncle of the famous American impressionist painter, Winslow Homer. Benson hired architect Hamden McIntyre, creator of the former Christian Brothers winery--now the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone--to design the building. Constructed against a hillside in western Oakville, Far Niente functioned as a gravity flow winery, gently moving the grapes through each stage of production.Far Niente prospered until the onset of Prohibition in 1919, when it was abandoned and left to fall into disrepair. Sixty years later, in 1979, Gil Nickel purchased the winery and adjacent vineyard and began a three-year restoration of the property, which resulted in placement on the National Register of Historical Places. During restoration, the original name, Far Niente, from an Italian phrase that romantically translated means ""without a care,"" was found carved in stone on the front of the building where it remains to this day. We felt an obligation to preserve the name with the hope that we could recapture a bygone era when life was indeed without a care.Nineteen eighty-two marked the return of winemaking to Far Niente, with the harvest of the winery's first Cabernet Sauvignon. Chardonnay was also produced at the winery for the first time that year; the 1979, '80 and '81 vintage wines were made at an offsite location. Today, the winery continues to focus on producing only the two varietal wines.";Chardonnay;;white;Chardonnay;;2018;;;;Far Niente Chardonnay 2018.jpg;1500;119.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15
USA;California;California;Francis Ford Coppola;Francis Ford Coppola Winery;"""I've always been influenced by the idea of Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen, which was the inspiration for ultimately all modern amusements parks. I remember the beautiful theater pavilions with the curtains painted with peacock feathers that had little ballet performances. At Tivoli, there were rides, but more important than the rides were the cafes and the refreshments, and just the sense of being in a children's garden, a 'pleasure garden' for all people to enjoy – which perhaps is the best phrase to describe what we're creating here. This vision was replicated at places on Coney Island, like Luna Park, and George C. Tilyou's Steeplechase Park, or Palisades Park. These were basically wonderlands, and I thought Francis Ford Coppola Winery could become such a park for the family to go and enjoy, where there are things for kids to do, so they can be close to their parents who are sampling wines and foods.I've often felt that modern life tends to separate all the ages too much. In the old days, the children lived with the parents and the grandparents, and the family unit each gave one another something very valuable. So when we began to develop the idea for this winery, we thought it should be like a resort, basically a wine wonderland, a park of pleasure where people of all ages can enjoy the best things in life – food, wine, music, dancing, games, swimming and performances of all types.

They managed to make a connection with Renaissance Winery (where Gideon had made his earliest, incredible wines, as well as many of the first vintages of Clos Saron), which was no longer producing their own wine, and leased their oldest producing vines.This had three immediate effects.

USA;California;Sonoma Coast;St. Francis;St. Francis Winery;For more than four decades, the wines of St. Francis Winery & Vineyards have reflected the finest mountain and valley vineyards in Sonoma County. Our founder, Joe Martin, fell in love with Sonoma Valley and established St. Francis Vineyard in 1971, planting 22 acres of Chardonnay and the first 60 acres of Merlot in Sonoma Valley. After achieving great success as a grower, Joe opened his own winery in 1979 with his business partner Lloyd Canton.Our first winemaker, Tom Mackey, joined St. Francis in 1983 and was renowned for elevating both the quality and style of Sonoma Merlot as an ultra-premium, stand-alone varietal. He also cultivated an in-depth understanding of every Sonoma appellation, enabling us to acquire and develop new vineyards and expand our wine portfolio.In 1988 St. Francis partnered with the Kopf family, long admired for their historic family legacy in the wine and spirits industry and a commitment to quality. That legacy began in 1933 upon the repeal of prohibition when Rudy Kopf founded the wine and spirits department of Macy's Department Store in New York, turning it into what was then one of the finest wine and spirits retailers in the country. He later established his own wine and spirits company, now owned by his three daughters.Today, a new generation of winemakers, Katie Madigan and Chris Louton, continues our long tradition of luscious, elegant, fruit-driven wines from Sonoma County grapes.  We farm more than 400 acres of Certified Sustainable estate vineyards in Sonoma Valley and Russian River Valley, each with varying compositions of loam, clay and volcanic soils.

After flying the globe for many years as the head-winemaker for the likes of Simi, Allied Domecq, and Beam Estates, Nick decided to start a family company with his wife Yolyn in 1998. The goal of the company was to focus on site specific wine making from great vineyard sites from around the world. Having produced so many world class wines from around the globe, Nick knew exactly from which vineyard sites he would choose to make his wines.The wines Nick and Yolyn Goldschmidt produce are all single vineyard, handcrafted, small production, artisan wines.WINEMAKERBorn in Auckland, Nick found his way to viticulture through a slightly tortuous route. After completing his Bachelor of Science at Canterbury, he ended up in a research position at Lincoln University in 1982. After a year of working in organics, plant breeding and in the small vineyard, Nick pursued a Diploma in Horticulture at Lincoln. From there he went to Charles Sturt University in Australia to study viticulture. Then, after three vintages back in New Zealand, he returned to South Australia to complete his post graduate degree in Winemaking at Roesworthy. His first vintage in California was in 1989 with Carneros Creek making Pinot and then in Chile as winemaker for Caliterra. In 1990 he became the VP/Winemaker for the Simi Winery in California. During his time there he also developed his own brands: Forefathers and Goldschmidt Vineyard. Simi Winery was owned by LVMH where he helped with Cloudy Bay NZ, Terrazas Arg and the Italian brand, Ruffino. Simi was eventually purchased by Constellation in 1999. In 2003 Nick became Senior VP/Winemaker for Allied-Domecq where he managed winemaking in California brands such as Clos du Bois, Atlas Peak, William Hill, Buena Vista and Gary Farrell to name a few. In 2006 Allied-Domecq was sold to Jim Beam and Nick continued on overseeing all California winemaking but also including Geyser Peak and Wild Horse. Starting in 2008 Nick went full time on his own, making single vineyard wines and continuing to consult for 16 wineries in 6 countries.

USA;California;Central Coast;Wild Horse;Wild Horse Vineyards;Located in historic Templeton, Wild Horse Winery was named for the wild mustangs that roamed the hills east of the vineyard estate. Descendents of the first Spanish horses brought to California, these mavericks suggest a free, noble spirit. They are the ideal symbol for the Wild Horse Winery commitment to spirited winemaking.Wild Horse Winery founder, Ken Volk, originally selected the Templeton vineyard and winery location in 1981 for its low vigor soils, proven ground water table, proximity to Estero Bay and rural atmosphere. Situated at a midpoint in the Central Coast, this location is ideal for sourcing fruit from vineyards north and south of the winery. Wild Horse Winery remains a champion of Central Coast winegrowing, committed to sustainable viticultural practices and creating fine wines that express the region's diversity.The varieties of soil composition and microclimates that can be found within the expansive Central Coast appellation present the opportunity to cultivate the same varietal in a wide range of growing conditions. This fact forms a key philosophy for Wild Horse Winery winemaking: multi-vineyard sourcing. While estate or vineyard-designated wines can be outstanding, they offer just one expression of the grapes from which they are produced. Growing the same varietal in different terroirs and then carefully blending the individual lots, sourcing fruit and working with many of the same growers for generations.;Pinot Noir;;red;Pinot Noir;;2017;;;;Wild Horse Pinot Noir 2017.jpg;750;13.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

USA;New York;Seneca Lake;Red Newt;Red Newt Cellars;Red Newt Cellars is located on the east side of Seneca Lake in the hamlet of Hector in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Red Newt Cellars was founded in 1998 by David and Debra Whiting. Wine production was started with the 1998 vintage with a mere 1,200 cases of Chardonnay, Riesling, Vidal, Cayuga, Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot. The first white wines were released at the grand opening of the winery and restaurant in July of 1999.Debra and David have received recognition from local and regional press as well as from national publications such as Food and Wine, Nations Restaurant News, and Wine Spectator. Recently, Red Newt Cellars has been named among Wine & Spirits Magazine’s 2011 Top 100 wineries of the year. The Wine Spectator describes David and Debra as “untrammeled lovers of the Finger Lakes scene,” and it couldn’t be more true. David and Debra Whiting met in the late 1980s. At that time David was working as cellar master at a Finger Lakes winery while Debra was supervising microbiology labs at Cornell University. Following a passion for food and wine, David continued his oenological career as winemaker at three different wineries in the Finger Lakes. Debra’s path led her into a gourmet cheesecake business and then an upscale catering business. When the opportunity arose in 1998, David started wine production with the 1998 vintage and the following summer Debra opened the Red Newt Bistro concurrent with the first wine releases in June of 1999. Red Newt Cellars represented the achievement of David and Debra’s longtime goal to combine their efforts and expertise in the exploration of regional wine and cuisine. Their focus was on not only producing exceptional wines and food, but also creating a synergy between them.;Red Newt Cellars Circle Riesling;;white;;;2019;;;;Red Newt Cellars Circle Riesling 2019.jpg;750;10.45;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

USA;Oregon;Dundee Hills;Domaine Serene;Domaine Serene;"Grace and Ken Evenstad first arrived and settled in the Dundee Hills in the Willamette Valley in 1989. At that time, the couple had spent over 20 years together in Minnesota building a successful business, a loving family, and a deep appreciation for the wines of Burgundy.  The Evenstads had faith in Oregon early on, before there was a national market for domestic Pinot Noir. When the time came to pursue their longtime dream of growing and producing world class Pinot Noir, they invested in a 42 acre hilltop estate that had just been logged in the beautiful Dundee Hills of Oregon. With the support of their family - and to the surprise of many of their friends in Minnesota – the Evenstads established Domaine Serene, effectively creating Oregon's luxury wine industry. They named the winery after their daughter, Serene, and their first vineyard on the estate was named after their son, Mark Bradford Evenstad.Today, Domaine Serene produces Pinot Noir from six vineyard estates, spanning three Willamette Valley AVAs, and Chardonnay solely from high elevations in the Dundee Hills. In 2001, the Evenstads completed construction of the picturesque, state-of-the art, five-level, gravity flow winery specifically designed to make world class Pinot Noir. Their sustainable vineyard management and winemaking practices are intended to maximize the quality of the wines and to ensure complex, balanced and elegant wines that are age-worthy. Since the first vintage in 1990, Domaine Serene has produced award winning wines, including Evenstad Reserve Pinot Noir, recognized as the World's #3 Wine of 2013 by Wine Spectator Magazine. Through the continuous pursuit of quality and innovation, Domaine Serene has garnered global recognition as an iconic quality leader of Pinot Noir and Chardonnay. In April 2015, the Evenstads expanded upon their original vision of producing world class Pinot Noir and Chardonnay by purchasing Château de la Crée, a Burgundy wine estate in the Côte d'Or.  Burgundy vintners have been buying vineyards in Oregon for the past 25 years, but now the Evenstads have flipped the trend. ""Owning and farming legendary vineyards in Burgundy is a dream come true for us,"" says Ken Evenstad.

USA;Oregon;Willamette Valley;Patricia Green;Patricia Green Cellars;"Patricia Green Cellars is located in the Ribbon Ridge district of Yamhill County on the 52 acre estate purchased in 2000 by Patty Green and Jim Anderson. The winery, and thus the two friends, are noted for producing a tremendously broad selection of Pinot Noirs from far flung vineyards representing some of the better sites in the Ribbon Ridge, Dundee Hills, Chehalem Mountains, and the Eola Hills growing regions. All of the vineyards we either maintain or purchase fruit from are extremely well-tended sites that seek to grow the best fruit possible through rigorous attention to detail on every single vine. To ensure that our sites truly show the characteristics of the soil, micro-climate and clonal material none of them use irrigation.We have cobbled together over the years a collection of vineyard sites, whole and in part, that we feel represent some of the better sites from the best appellations in the state. The crowning jewel was landing what is now our Estate Vineyard. On top of that though we have other sites that are almost exclusively between 15-35 years in vine age. While old vines won't necessarily mean that the wine is better than wine from younger vines the likelihood that a well managed and well situated site will produce better wine from its older vines than its younger ones is extremely high. We are fortunate to have this large cache of older vines, many of which we have worked with for an extended period of time which is also extremely important as it gives you knowledge of the site, how it ripens, when it ripens, what flavor characteristics one should expect, how the wine ferments, what barrels best match the wine and so on. We chose these sites because we felt they were unique, compelling and produced excellent fruit.In the winery the philosophy of attention to the smallest details is further extended all the way from the fermenting must to the final bottling process. At a larger level the philosophy of the winery is fairly simple: Do what needs to be done. We feel that you simply cannot enter into a vintage with pre-conceived notions of what is going to happen, what our fruit is going to be like, what our wines are going to be like and what we are going to need to do to turn our fruit into the best wines possible. There are certain approaches and techinques that we will obviously look to apply (for instance, sorting fruit, cold soaking must, punching down, etc. are all things that are going to happen) however we consider the intensity of those actions as fluid. That fluid nature would extend to nearly every aspect of our winemaking. Our winery, the equipment within and the people that work for us are our tools for making the best wine we can. We apply those tools as liberally or as conservatively as we think best suits the situation with which we are presented. Ultimately we try to do things simply. The 14th century friar William of Ockham stated that ""one should not increase, beyond what is necessary, the number of entities required to explain anything."" This is the physics theory known as Occam's Razor. It applies to winemaking though, too. With a combined 42 years worth of winemaking experience we have come to realize that the hardest thing to do is to do the simplest things. Again, this does not mean we do not take action when necessary, it means that we do what needs to be done.Farming Practice:Practicing Organic";Patria Green Marie Muscat Ottonel;;white;;;2019;;;;Patria Green Marie Muscat Ottonel 2019.jpg;750;19.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15

About 140 acres produce grapes, although 50 acres are young vines.In 1996, Shea decided to start his own winery, and more than a decade later, Drew Voit is now making the wine to much acclaim. Voit was consulting with Domaine Serene before working at Shea. Now he has multiple clones (Pommard, Dijon and Wäidenswil) and multiple vineyard sites to work with. Dick Shea's vineyard is really two separated vineyards, and they have most clones planted. They use different blocks to blend into their main wine, the Estate Pinot, and then they have single block wines as well.Voit's hard work, experience and skill all but guarantee many great vintages to come from Shea.Farming Practice:Practicing Organic";Shea Wine Cellars Chardonnay;;white;Chardonnay;;2017;;;;Shea Wine Cellars Chardonnay 2017.jpg;750;31.95;USD;exc;EmpireWine;USA;ecommerce;2021-04-15
